bonds that tie the objects in her hands to the person who once owned them. As she inhales, her eyes roll back and her eyelids flutter while her mind fills with a vision of a far away place. Through the haze, she sees the young half-dwarf she was searching for and the filthy tavern room he was hiding in.</p><p>A halfling watches intently as the planchette moves across the board, hovering over one letter after another. As the letters string together into a name, the identity of the murder she's been chasing reveals itself and she raises one hand to her mouth in horror.</p><p>Stopping suddenly, a lemurian listens intently to a sound no of his companions heard. Something had followed him back from the Ethereal Plane. Something too dangerous to leave be. He turns quickly, making a sign of exorcism in the air while walking towards the dark presence.</p><p>Spiritualists are mediums, bridging the worlds of the living and the dead. Having barely escaped an encounter with death themselves, spiritualists commune with restless spirits for mystical power. They use their spells and occult talents to ensure their second chance at life isn't wasted.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2305\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Brush with Death</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Not everyone who has a near death experience becomes a spiritualist but all spiritualists have survived an encounter that brought them to the brink of death. Spiritualists remember the specifics of the event unclearly. They often recall an ominous figure stepping out from the darkness offering an extension on their lives but further details, such as the cost of the favor, elude them. This incident was the catalyst for the acquisition of their occult powers, from spellcasting to communing with the dead to seeing beyond the borders of the physical realm.</p><p>The specific circumstances of a spiritualist's brush with death leaves a permanent impression on them. Those who survive the attack of a wild beast find they have the ability to command such predators following the experience. Spiritualists that survive a potentially fatal illness discover they can withstand diseases and toxins that would have previously been lethal.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2306\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Veil</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Before they can see spirits, spiritualists can sense them. In the presence of ethereal beings the hair on the back of their necks will stand up or they'll get a splitting migraine or they hear the sound of a river rushing when none is nearby. Soon after they learn to beckon spirits to the share their minds and bodies. Then at last the spiritualist's eyes open to the world they already knew existed, the world of spirits that coexists alongside the physical realm.</p><p>Novice spiritualists quickly discover that, while the world is full of dead people, they tend to attract a certain type. The reason for this isn't precisely known, but among themselves spiritualists believe that the kinds of spirits they resonate with are representative of the spiritualist's own repressed or unexpressed emotions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2307\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Spiritualist</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Spiritualists are torn between the worlds of the living and the dead. As you create your spiritualist character, the most important question to consider is: how do you see your role as a medium between these two worlds? Are your abilities the unwanted repercussions of a traumatic experience you'll never forget? Did the instance of your brush with death mark the start of a new and better life for you? Do you wish you could turn your senses away from the spirits of the departed? Did your awareness of the ethereal realm bring about an unexpected reunion with someone you lost?</p><p>Spiritualists are further defined by the circumstances of their near death experience and the spirits they most frequently contact. Were you the child of a minor noble, targeted for assassination as a way of intimidating the upper class? Did you grow up in a rural village only to find that one year a plague swept through and only you survived? Were you traveling from one city to the next when a pack of wolves set upon you and your caravan and nearly took your life? The moment you came within a breath of dying, but didn't, you became a spiritualist.</p><p>As a spiritualist, the unquiet dead seek you out, pleading for you to intervene on their behalf. What kind of requests are you most sympathetic to? Has a spirit ever asked you to do something you were unwilling to do? Have you ever agreed to help a spirit and later regretted it? Do you feel greater responsibility to the dead or the living? Are the spirits of the departed tools to use for your own gain or companions in their own right?</p><p>The answer to these questions will define you as a spiritualist.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2308\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>You can make a spiritualist quickly by following these suggestions.

Through the haze, she sees the young half-dwarf she was searching for and the filthy tavern room he was hiding in.</p><p>A halfling watches intently as the planchette moves across the board, hovering over one letter after another. As the letters string together into a name, the identity of the murder she's been chasing reveals itself and she raises one hand to her mouth in horror.</p><p>Stopping suddenly, a lemurian listens intently to a sound no of his companions heard. Something had followed him back from the Ethereal Plane. Something too dangerous to leave be. He turns quickly, making a sign of exorcism in the air while walking towards the dark presence.</p><p>Spiritualists are mediums, bridging the worlds of the living and the dead. Having barely escaped an encounter with death themselves, spiritualists commune with restless spirits for mystical power. They use their spells and occult talents to ensure their second chance at life isn't wasted.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2305\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Brush with Death</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Not everyone who has a near death experience becomes a spiritualist but all spiritualists have survived an encounter that brought them to the brink of death. Spiritualists remember the specifics of the event unclearly. They often recall an ominous figure stepping out from the darkness offering an extension on their lives but further details, such as the cost of the favor, elude them. This incident was the catalyst for the acquisition of their occult powers, from spellcasting to communing with the dead to seeing beyond the borders of the physical realm.</p><p>The specific circumstances of a spiritualist's brush with death leaves a permanent impression on them. Those who survive the attack of a wild beast find they have the ability to command such predators following the experience. Spiritualists that survive a potentially fatal illness discover they can withstand diseases and toxins that would have previously been lethal.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2306\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beyond the Veil</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Before they can see spirits, spiritualists can sense them. In the presence of ethereal beings the hair on the back of their necks will stand up or they'll get a splitting migraine or they hear the sound of a river rushing when none is nearby. Soon after they learn to beckon spirits to the share their minds and bodies. Then at last the spiritualist's eyes open to the world they already knew existed, the world of spirits that coexists alongside the physical realm.</p><p>Novice spiritualists quickly discover that, while the world is full of dead people, they tend to attract a certain type. The reason for this isn't precisely known, but among themselves spiritualists believe that the kinds of spirits they resonate with are representative of the spiritualist's own repressed or unexpressed emotions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2307\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Spiritualist</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Spiritualists are torn between the worlds of the living and the dead. As you create your spiritualist character, the most important question to consider is: how do you see your role as a medium between these two worlds? Are your abilities the unwanted repercussions of a traumatic experience you'll never forget? Did the instance of your brush with death mark the start of a new and better life for you? Do you wish you could turn your senses away from the spirits of the departed? Did your awareness of the ethereal realm bring about an unexpected reunion with someone you lost?</p><p>Spiritualists are further defined by the circumstances of their near death experience and the spirits they most frequently contact. Were you the child of a minor noble, targeted for assassination as a way of intimidating the upper class? Did you grow up in a rural village only to find that one year a plague swept through and only you survived? Were you traveling from one city to the next when a pack of wolves set upon you and your caravan and nearly took your life? The moment you came within a breath of dying, but didn't, you became a spiritualist.</p><p>As a spiritualist, the unquiet dead seek you out, pleading for you to intervene on their behalf. What kind of requests are you most sympathetic to? Has a spirit ever asked you to do something you were unwilling to do? Have you ever agreed to help a spirit and later regretted it? Do you feel greater responsibility to the dead or the living? Are the spirits of the departed tools to use for your own gain or companions in their own right?</p><p>The answer to these questions will define you as a spiritualist.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2308\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>You can make a spiritualist quickly by following these suggestions.
