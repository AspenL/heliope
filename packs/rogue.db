for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p><p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin's blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p><p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p><p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation.

Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1292\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Shady Living</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1293\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rogue</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character's relationship to the law.

Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?</p><p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1294\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions.
