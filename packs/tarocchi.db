This card is sometimes affectionately referred to as a kitty card. Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this game, you can <b>play</b> a card for a spell of 5th level or lower, naming the spell you cast into it. However, unlike a normal casting of the spell, you can identify the card as a kitty card. This traps the spell's magic in the card, but does not cast the spell immediately. </p><p>Once a card has been designated a kitty card, it can be given to any other creature to hold on to. At any time, that creature can touch the kitty card and use an action to say a code word (that you both come up with together). This allows the creature to cast the spell. The spell activates as though you were casting it. This includes using your level (if the card is a cantrip), and using your spell save DC for any targets which are affected by the spell. However, the range and area activate from the creature holding the card, which chooses any targets and makes any spell attack rolls required (although their roll still uses your spell attack ability modifier). If the spell requires concentration, the creature activating the spell must maintain concentration on it.</p><p>You can have one kitty card active at a time. If you create a new kitty card before an existing one is activated, the old kitty card loses its power. Regardless of when it is created, all cards (including unexpended kitty cards) return to your deck when you finish a long rest.</p></div><div data-source=\"ATannerTarocchi\" class=\"rd__b refreshing-brew rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1686\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trump Card</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"The Tarocchi and expanded card magic\">ATT</span> p7</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Starting at 6th level, you can get the jump on foes who think they have the advantage.

rested upon a chairacross from him. A fair maiden enter the room. Immediately, he tosses his hood back, and kicks the chair out from his table. He invites her to sit, gesturing to the seat before beginning to lightly shuffle a deck of cards. He draws three, and places them on the table. She nods, and immediately moves to sit with him. </p><p>A party of adventurers stand at the feet of a mighty slain dragon. It was a hard fought battle, and even harder won. They look to their leader, who also lay fallen, gasping ragged breaths. A woman in loose robes approaches him, kneeling quietly and smiling. Wordlessly, she pulls a playing card out of her sleeve and presses it against the fallen warrior. His vitality returns, and the group breathes a sigh of relief. </p><p>A slight, older man sits in an ornate chair to the side of a great king. The kingdom has fallen into chaos, and there is talk of rebellion. The king turns to his advisor and asks how he can stop this problem before it gets worse. The old man smiles, adjusts his glasses, and pulls out a deck of cards. He begins laying them on a table in an indecipherable pattern. Finally, he places a single card into the middle of the pattern. He hesitates for just a moment before drawing the card. He smiles, and convinces the king that his rule can be assured. </p><p>Tarocchi are mysterious wielders of magic, not using simple wands or staves, but drawing power from decks of cards. The luck of the draw, and the irony of not having a card you need, is never lost on a tarocchi, who is able to see the long term goal, and make use of what hand of cards they are dealt, both from their power packs, and from life itself. </p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1619\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Power Pack</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A tarocchi's most powerful weapon is their power pack, a deck of cards infused with magical abilities that only they can wield. Sometimes these power packs are legendary artifacts, with intricate artwork on the back, and court cards depicting powerful rulers and tyrants, signifying these decks as special. </p><p>Often, however, these decks simply appear as ordinary playing cards, allowing a tarocchi to feign innocence of their magical abilities. Indeed, power packs can be used as an ordinary deck of cards, and even if the cards are lost or destroyed, they will reform in the tarocchi's pack by the light of the next morning, as arcane magic binds the two together. </p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1620\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Living As Tarocchi</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Unfortunatley for tarocchi, their magical abilities do not often lend themselves to finding steady work. The unreliability of their powers make others reluctant to employ them, or to rely on them. For this reason, tarocchi often regard their magical abilities as a sort of hobby, one which they must practice and hone in their free time, while finding work elsewhere.</p><p>The exception to this are tarocchi who are charismatic enough to find themselves in the employ of a thieves' guild, and who can convince the criminals with which they would work that their skills are valuable and reliable, so long as everyone else can be flexible. But to those who can be, a tarocchi is a powerful ally, capable of drawing new hope from their deck, even when all seems lost.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1621\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating A Tarocchi</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As you create your tarocchi character, think about your personal deck of cards.

Did you purchase them from a mysterious merchant, whom no one else remembers? </p><p>You must also decide where your magical powers came from, as it is the blending of magic and a power pack that makes a tarocchi. Do you have an ancestral bloodline of magic users, whose arcane abilities have been born in you? Have you bonded with an otherworldly being, granting you powerful magic abilities? Or did you find your deck of cards and determine to learn more, poring over and studying ancienct texts to determine the true power of the cards?</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"1622\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You can make a tarocchi quickly by following these suggestions.
