rule the Seven Cities of Hell scheme and plot endlessly, eternally. Each seeks to bring the others to heel. To ascend to the Throne of Hell, unite the seven cities and every infernal thing that lives there, and lead an infinite army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.</p><p>Their elite shock troops, the terror-commandos of Hell, are the <i>illriggers</i>. Knights of Hell, they are charismatic counter-paladins who master devils, disrupt enemy organizations, and command Hell's armies.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2216\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Order of Desolation</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[â€“]</span></span></h2> <p>Millennia ago, the Lords of Hell did something remarkable: they cooperated. They came together to create the Order of Desolation, knights sworn to serve Hell first, their patron archdevil second.</p><p>Acceptance into the Order of Desolation makes you a comrade with every other illrigger, regardless of which archdevil you serve. Each archdevil has churches, underground fanes, secret societies, cults. All with leaders manically devoted to the archdevil who grants them their power. But this association of illriggers consider themselves above the petty political squabbles that divide the seven cities.</p><p>Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate, are expected to be intelligent, resourceful, tactical, manipulative. A temple or cult might conclude that the presence of an illrigger in their midst is a sign that their archdevil approves of their actions, but the illriggers are independent. The order was founded to give the Lords of Hell agents capable of acting across the timescape, free from the direct control of their patron. An illrigger has many powerful abilities granted by their archdevil, but more precious is their patron's trust. Left to their own devices, the illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision.</p><p>It is not unusual, therefore, for a member of the Order of Desolation to rely on other members of the order first, even from illriggers who serve other archdevils, before going to any church, cult, or temple devoted to their own archdevil.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div data-source=\"ILL\" class=\"rd__b refreshing-brew rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2217\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: MCDM - The Illrigger Class\">Forked Tongue</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[â€“]</span></span></h2> <p>You have a facility with speech and know how to manipulate an audience.
