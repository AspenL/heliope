When their companion is enraged, a beastheart channels that ferocity into supernatural deeds of martial prowess. In return, the wild companion can harness the beastheart's focus and direction.</p><p>This supernatural kinship can form over a long period of time. Some beasthearts bond with unorthodox pets or wild protectors as children, becoming ever closer as both grow up together. Other beasthearts come of age in the wilderness, raised among wild creatures—or even raised by them—as a means of learning to respect and embrace the might of nature. But the beastheart bond can also form more quickly, typically in times of great duress. A person lost and starving in the wild might become a beastheart when they connect with a creature that saves their life by providing food and shelter Or a wild creature injured and beset by poachers can befriend a character who saves their life, with the creature's gratitude forging the beastheart bond.</p><p>Not every person is cut out to become a beastheart, just as not every animal is meant to be a companion.

Instead, a beastheart views themself as a caregiver, looking after a companion whose heart is as fierce and open as their own. The companion shares a similar view, thinking of their beastheart as a member of the pack, and treating a caregiver as a sibling always ready to explore, hunt, and play.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2110\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wild at Heart</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>To an outsider, a beastheart and a companion might appear to be equals (The companion most likely feels that way!) But the beastheart is always aware that their companion is a force of nature, not a domesticated creature. As such, a beastheart accepts that their companion might not be capable of deep introspection, as most companions live for the moment, dwell not on the past, and give little thought to the future. It's thus the beastheart's responsibility to do those things for themself and their wild friend, taking responsibility for a companion as a parent might care for a child, and grieving if the wild heart they've cared for is ever stilled.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2111\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Untamed Pair</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Like the companions who stalk and explore at their sides, beasthearts bear a wondrous connection to the natural world, allowing them to track prey, survive in harsh environments, and get along even with wild creatures that aren't their companions. Many beasthearts are most at home in the wilderness, sleeping under the stars and enjoying the bounty of nature. Even when beasthearts and their companions make their lives in towns or cities, the untamed wilds beyond a settlement or the subterranean depths beneath it are often on their minds, constantly calling them to adventure.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2112\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Beastheart</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As you create your beastheart character, consider the history of your friendship with your companion. Did you fnd the creature as a child and grow up together? Or did you form a bond with them only recently? Is this the first companion you've had, and are you the first person to whom your companion has bonded in this way? Think about the moment you became friends and the trials you've already faced. You might have survived in the wilderness together while one of you was injured. You might have saved your companion from trophy hunters. Or your companion might have instead saved your life by fighting off a deadly enemy.</p><p>Consider your companion's personality and tastes. Are they rambunctious or lazy? Standoffish or friendly? What tricks can you perform together? What is your companion's favorite food? You should also think about how your companion and you complement each other in looks or personality. Does your appearance reflect or contrast theirs? What activities do you both enjoy? How do you communicate with your companion? And how do you encourage others to communicate with and show respect for your friend?</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2113\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick Build</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>You can make a beastheart quickly by following these suggestions.
