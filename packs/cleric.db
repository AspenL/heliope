symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.</p><p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods.

Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.</p><p>Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.</p><p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"343\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Divine Agents</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.</p><p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p><p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"344\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Cleric</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody.

The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit's anchor within the mortal shell. The Gods of Blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one's own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson. Almost any neutral or evil deity can claim some influence over the secrets of blood magic and this domain, while the gods who watch from more moral realms shun its use beyond extenuating circumstance.</p><p>When casting divine spells as a Blood Domain cleric, consider ways to occasionally flavor your descriptions to tailor the magic's effect on the opponent's blood and vitality. Hold person might involve locking a target's body into place from the blood stream out, preventing them from moving. Cure wounds may feature the controlling of blood like a needle and thread to close lacerations.

It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as @deity[Torm], @deity[Heironeous|Greyhawk], and @deity[Kiri-Jolith|Dragonlance]) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as @deity[Erythnul|Greyhawk], @deity[the Fury|Eberron], @deity[Gruumsh|Nonhuman], and @deity[Ares|Greek]) and gods of conquest and domination (such as @deity[Bane], @deity[Hextor|Greyhawk], and @deity[Maglubiyet|Nonhuman]). Other war gods (such as @deity[Tempus], @deity[Nike|Greek], and @deity[Nuada|Celtic]) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p><p>At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>War Domain Spells</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Cleric Level</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">1st</td><td class=\"col-10\">@spell[divine favor], @spell[shield of faith]</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">3rd</td><td class=\"col-10\">@spell[magic weapon], @spell[spiritual weapon]</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">5th</td><td class=\"col-10\">@spell[crusader's mantle], @spell[spirit guardians]</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">7th</td><td class=\"col-10\">@spell[freedom of movement], @spell[stoneskin]</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\">9th</td><td class=\"col-10\">@spell[flame strike], @spell[hold monster]</td></tr></tbody></table><div data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"523\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bonus Proficiencies</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Player’s Handbook\">PHB</span> p63</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.</p></div><div data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"524\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">War Priest</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Player’s Handbook\">PHB</span> p63</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>From 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you while you are engaged in battle.

On Ravnica, the domain is favored by clerics of the Azorius Senate, who use it to maintain and enforce the law, and of the Orzhov Syndicate, who exploit law and order for their personal gain. On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include @deity[Bane], @deity[Tyr], @deity[Majere|Dragonlance], @deity[Erathis|Dawn War|DMG], @deity[Pholtus|Greyhawk], @deity[Wee Jas|Greyhawk], @deity[Aureon|Eberron], @deity[Maglubiyet|Nonhuman], @deity[Nuada|Celtic], @deity[Athena|Greek], @deity[Anubis|Egyptian], @deity[Forseti|Norse], and @deity[Asmodeus|Dawn War|DMG].</p><p>The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule.

Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.</p><p>Law establishes hierarchies.

On other worlds, gods who grant access to this domain include @deity[Bane], @deity[Tyr], @deity[Majere|Dragonlance], @deity[Erathis|Dawn War|DMG], @deity[Pholtus|Greyhawk], @deity[Wee Jas|Greyhawk], @deity[Aureon|Eberron], @deity[Maglubiyet|Nonhuman], @deity[Nuada|Celtic], @deity[Athena|Greek], @deity[Anubis|Egyptian], @deity[Forseti|Norse], and @deity[Asmodeus|Dawn War|DMG].</p><p>The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule. Clerics of order are typically concerned with how things are done, rather than whether an action's results are just. Following the law and obeying its edicts is critical, especially when it benefits these clerics and their guilds or deities.</p><p>Law establishes hierarchies. Those selected by the law to lead must be obeyed. Those who obey must do so to the best of their ability.

The Gods of Blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one's own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson.

Hold person might involve locking a target's body into place from the blood stream out, preventing them from moving. Cure wounds may feature the controlling of blood like a needle and thread to close lacerations.
