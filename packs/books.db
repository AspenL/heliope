For example:</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"145\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Offering Work.</span></span> <p>\"Look what the cat dragged in\"; \"Uh oh, here comes trouble\"; greetings suggesting a teasing closeness.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"146\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Requesting Sanctuary.</span></span> <p>\"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes\"; \"Boy, am I glad to see you\"; greetings expressing relief.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"147\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lay Low.</span></span> <p>\"Long time no see\"; \"Feels like I haven't seen you in forever\"; greetings indicating a long period between meetings.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><p>If a rogue requests and is provided sanctuary of any sort by use of the Strange Approach, it is generally regarded that repayment take the form of an owed favour. To demand coin in return for the service of protection is deemed poor taste, and work for such a tradesman would dry up in the city as word got around that they weren't good to work with. For the dishonest, reputation is everything.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"148\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dishonest Employment</span></h2> <p>Once a cant greeting has been accepted, an offer may be floated by the approaching employer, disguised as conversational catching up. This offer will provide the basic outline of the illegal work to be done, allowing those propositioned to decide whether or not they're interested in taking on the job. The type of task to be completed is already assumed based on the advertised speciality of the hiree, so ordinarily this conversation covers:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Whether the contract is personal or on behalf of a syndicate;</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The anticipated difficulty in carrying out the work;</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The amount of payment proposed; and</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A location at which both parties may meet later for further details.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"149\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Catching Up</span></h2> <p>When a greeting is accepted, it is customary for the hiree to enquire as to the employer's wellbeing. From there the employer is obliged to answer that they are either <b><i>\"on my own these days\"</i></b> if the job is for them personally, or <b><i>\"starting a family\"</i></b> or similar if the job is on behalf of a larger group. Some might wish to steer clear of crime family work, for example, or to remain unafiliated with a cause and this could be their only opportunity to turn down the offer of work without causing offense.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"150\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How's Your Dad?</span></h2> <p>The conversation will then move to the general foreseen difficulty of a contract. This will be measured by the health status of a fabricated loved one of the employer. The scale may range from a simple task when the loved one is <b><i>\"well\"</i></b> to a potentially deadly challenge if hey have <b><i>\"passed away\"</i></b>. If the obstacles are unknown, the health of the loved one will be similarly uncertain, <b><i>\"a bit touch and go\"</i></b>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"151\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Compensation</span></h2> <p>Payment is also usually discussed during this 'catch up', however the onus is on the hiree rogue to ensure such - if an inexperienced thief takes a job without negotiating remuneration and winds up with little reward to show for their efforts, the fault lies with them. Who are they gonna complain to, the guards?</p><p>A discussion of compensation may be brought to the conversation by the introduction of any topic enabling the inconspicuous use of numbers. By context a rogue should be able to glean whether the number indicates a multiplier of x100gp or x100pp, erring toward x100gp if in doubt. For example:</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"152\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Number of kids/grandkids.</span></span> <p>x100gp/x100pp respectively.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"153\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Number of younger/older siblings.</span></span> <p>x100gp/x100pp respectively.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"154\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Age of child.</span></span> <p>Always x100gp.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><p>Haggling for amounts is acceptable, but it is impolite to follow up with an uncertain attendance to the 'card game' for more details on the job; either accept the contract or turn it down.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"155\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rendezvous</span></h2> <p>The location for further details will always be given as a card game at a particular address, commonly a safehouse, at a specified time.</p><p>If the hiree is accepting the work offered, they should indicate their intent to attend the card game. If not, it is not uncommon practice to express uncertainty at one's ability to attend, reserving the option to pick up the job at the time of the card game, or formally accept or decline once more details have been learned. If taking this tactic, however, the hiree rogue should expect competitors to the contract to have been gathered in the mean time, likely lessening their potential earnings.</p><p>As an optional extra, the informational card game may be described as a \"private game\" if the contract is being offered to this rogue alone, or a \"party\" if it is to be a team operation or a matter of first in best dressed.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"156\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Example Conversation</span></h1> <p>Dorian is a rogue displaying his parallel bars while going about his business in the city. He wears two rings on the second and fourth fingers of his right hand, each of them a double band, one etched silver and the other plain.</p><p>Before too long he is approached by a bright-smiled elven woman with twinned bangles pushed up her wrist to make them hold their place</p><p>\"Someone pinch me, I thought you'd never show your face in these parts again!

I thought you'd moved out East, how are you?\"</p><p>\"The family moved, I stayed here on my own. Doing pretty well for myself, actually.\" She shrugs in faux-faux-modesty.</p><p>\"Glad to hear it.\" His smile tightens at her boastfulness even though it's all an act. Annoying is annoying. \"I should ask, how have things been with Theodora since I last saw you? Any improvement?\"</p><p>She shifted, a notable loss of confidence. \"We lost Great Aunt Theo last year. But thankfully she got to spend a lot of time with all three kids and five grandkids before she passed.\"</p><p>\"I'm so sorry. It's good she was surrounded by so many loved ones\"</p><p>\"Hm. Yes. Well. C'est la vie!\" She perked up again and touched Dorian lightly on the arm. \"I've got to run, I'm meeting a friend, but we're planning a card game for a little after sundown - it's a cosy place on the corner of Market's Run and the West Alley; green door, planter box in the window, easy to spot. You should come!\"</p><p>Dorian winced thoughtfully. \"I'm really not sure if I can make it tonight, my companions will be expecting me...\"</p><p>\"Oh come on! I could tell you about the fight Theodora's younger sisters got into at the funeral; it will be fun I promise.\"</p><p>\"All five of them?\"</p><p>The woman ground her teeth a little. Dorian smiled pleasantly.</p><p>\"Only three, but it's still a killer story. A nice, quiet, private game.

{"name":"Spell Points","pages":[{"name":"Spell Points","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.</p><p>In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require spell points.</p><p>Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.</p><p>Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.</p><p>The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.</p><p>The Spell Points by Level table applies to @class[bard||bards], @class[cleric||clerics], @class[druid||druids], @class[sorcerer||sorcerers], and @class[wizard||wizards]. For a @class[paladin] or @class[ranger], halve the character's level in that class and then consult the table. For a @class[fighter|phb|fighter (Eldritch Knight)|Eldritch Knight] or @class[rogue|phb|rogue (Arcane Trickster)|Arcane Trickster], divide the character's level in that class by three.</p><p>This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Spell Point Cost</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-6 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Spell Level</th><th class=\"col-6 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Point Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">1st</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">2nd</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">3rd</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">4th</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">6</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">5th</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">7</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">6th</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">9</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">7th</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">10</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">8th</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">11</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">9th</td><td class=\"col-6 text-center\">13</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Spell Points by Level</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-4 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Class Level</th><th class=\"col-4 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Spell Points</th><th class=\"col-4 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Max Spell Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">1st</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">4</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">1st</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">2nd</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">6</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">1st</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">3rd</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">14</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">2nd</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">4th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">17</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">2nd</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">5th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">27</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">3rd</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">6th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">32</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">3rd</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">7th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">38</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">4th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">8th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">44</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">4th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">9th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">57</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">5th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">10th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">64</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">5th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">11th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">73</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">6th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">12th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">73</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">6th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">13th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">83</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">7th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">14th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">83</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">7th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">15th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">94</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">8th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">16th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">94</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">8th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">17th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">107</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">9th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">18th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">114</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">9th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">19th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">123</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">9th</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">20th</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">133</td><td class=\"col-4 text-center\">9th</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"wyGGnnZeUpolN0dz","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"DMG","hash":"spell%20points_dmg"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1668004736770,"modifiedTime":1668004736770,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"5P0SrLsxKfOMBt9E"}

Aerial combat doesn't happen a lot in roleplaying games, because it tends to be more cumbersome and less fun than combat on the ground—but in many stories that aren't RPGs, aerial battles happen all the time! The aim of Aces High is to emulate the thrill of those stories, and make you want to put more aerial combat in your games.</p><p>These rules are strictly aimed at combat encounters that take place entirely in the air.

You can find a vehicle or creature's flight modifier on the flight modifiers table on the next page.</p><p>When riding a mount, use the mount's flight modifier. When piloting a vehicle, use the vehicle's flight modifier.

Don't worry about the precise positioning of combatants, the direction they are flying, or their fly speed! You can safely assume that combatants are constantly changing direction while chasing each other, automatically making the best maneuvers they can—the only thing you need to know is whether or not they have a clear shot at each other. Measurements, including altitude (see \"Altitude Die\"), are abstractions when using these rules.</p><p>Using minis can be useful to help visualize the scene, but Aces High doesn't use a grid at all.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"161\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How to Play</span></h1> <p>While you can defeat an opponent by dealing damage to them, your primary objective in an Aces High encounter is to ground the enemy. Knocking your foes out of the sky is the fastest path to victory!</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"162\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Scramble!</span></h2> <p>When two or more combatants commit to aerial combat, all pilots involved must Scramble!</p><p>Scrambling sets the turn order and the starting altitude of each combatant. Much like standard initiative, combatants roll a d20 and add their flight modifier to the result, with higher results taking their turns first. However, unlike initiative, all combatants have 10 seconds to roll as many times as they want, trying to get the best possible result. Once the timer is up, everyone must use the result they have in front of them!11 Players using an online platform to play are able to roll much faster than normal, so consider cutting the time limit in half when playing online.</p><p>When flying any mount or vehicle, only the pilot needs to Scramble. Passengers don't need to Scramble—they take actions when their pilot does.</p><p>When a new combatant joins (or rejoins!) the fray, they Scramble without a timer, and use the first result they roll.</p><p>To find your opening altitude, don't add your flight modifier; all you need to do is look at the number on your d20, and match it to the corresponding Altitude on the Opening Altitude Table.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"163\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Altitude Die</span></h2> <p>Altitude is vital to both success and survival in an Aces High encounter. We track it on the Altitude Die, a d6 that you can place next to your character sheet or your mini. The higher the number, the higher you are!</p><p>Being above your target is an enormous tactical advantage that allows you to use the sun or other environmental conditions to make tracking your movement extremely difficult. A pilot is too engaged with flying to spend precious seconds craning their neck to squint at the sky! You have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets of a higher Altitude than you, unless you're a passenger.</p><p>As you might expect, this also means you have advantage on attack rolls against targets with an Altitude below yours. This advantage applies whether you're a pilot or a passenger.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Opening Altitude Table</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Altitude</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"4\">1-4</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"8\">5-8</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"9\" data-roll-max=\"12\">9-12</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"13\" data-roll-max=\"16\">13-16</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"17\" data-roll-max=\"20\">17-20</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">6</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"164\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Stunt Phase</span></h2> <p>Once everyone has Scrambled and set their Altitude Die, play begins. On each player's turn there are two phases; the stunt phase—in which you try to create angles of attack, and the action phase—in which you try to use them!</p><p>When your stunt phase starts, you roll a number of d4s equal to your flight modifier (minimum of 1 die). These are your Stunt Dice. You can spend them to alter your Altitude, or spend them to create Angles.</p><p>Unspent dice carry over to the next round. When your next stunt phase starts, roll a new set of d4s, and add them to the pile you had left over.</p><p>Your stunt phase ends when you say it does, or when you have no more Stunt Dice to spend.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"165\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating Angles</span></h3> <p>When you roll your Stunt Dice, the results are somewhat like a hand of cards. To create an Angle, you must match three-of-a-kind, or three-in-a-row. For example, 3-3-3 and 2-3-4 are both viable Angles. When you match and subsequently spend these dice, you gain an extra action to use during the action phase!</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"166\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Multiple Angles</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p></p><p>If you're fast enough, it's possible to create multiple Angles and therefore access more than the normal amount of actions in one turn, but only the fastest of creatures and vehicles can do this regularly! Generally speaking, it's more likely that a monster that's in their element when flying—like a roc, or a couatl—is going to be fast enough to really bend the action economy, but that's by design; dogfighting a roc should feel like a legendary encounter!</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"167\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adjusting Altitude</span></h3> <p>The other way to spend Stunt Dice during your stunt phase is to adjust your Altitude, either by climbing or diving. In both cases, you spend a Stunt Die and then alter your Altitude by the number on the spent Stunt Die. Climbing increments the Altitude Die, and diving decrements it.</p><p>You can only spend a Stunt Die to adjust your Altitude</p><p>once during your stunt phase.</p><p>When you choose to dive, the potential energy you've stored is transformed into momentum you can use to supercharge your speed! When you decrement your Altitude Die by the result of a spent Stunt Die, you can add that amount as a bonus to one of the following:</p><p>1. Your AC.</p><p>2. Your attack and damage rolls.</p><p>You keep these bonuses until the start of your next turn.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"168\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">High Altitude</span></h3> <p>Climbing above 6 on the Altitude Die means you've passed over into High Altitude. Upgrade your Altitude Die to a d12! For every point of Altitude you have above 6, you gain an extra Stunt Die to roll at the start of your stunt phase. You can't climb above Altitude 12.</p><p>However, any creature that ends its turn in High Altitude must make a Constitution saving throw to withstand the thinning air and plummeting temperature! Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed.</p><p>The DC for a High Altitude Constitution saving throw is the number on your Altitude Die x 2.</p><p>Any creature that fails this saving throw falls unconscious. This may or may not mean you start Freefalling, but it's likely that it does—an unconscious creature cannot fly, and if you're piloting a vehicle, you've probably passed out at the wheel.</p><p>You can repeat this saving throw in order to regain consciousness at the end of each of your turns, but the DC for repeated saving throws remains the same no matter your Altitude.</p><p>See \"Freefall\" below for more details.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"169\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Low Altitude</span></h3> <p>If your Altitude die shows a 1, then you are in Low Altitude, and just like High Altitude, it's dangerous. If your Altitude die ever decrements below 1, or you're in Freefall and you end your turn in Low Altitude, you hit the ground. And probably explode.</p><p>If you end your turn in Low Altitude and you're not Freefalling, make a Flight saving throw to avoid colliding with the ground, ocean, rooftops, lava, etc. The DC for this saving throw depends on the terrain, and so is determined by the GM. The sample encounter at the end of this article contains an example.</p><p>Whenever you hit the ground, either by failing the Low Altitude saving throw, or by decrementing below 1 on the Altitude die, you immediately take falling damage, as described under \"Freefall.\"</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"170\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Action Phase</span></h2> <p>After your stunt phase ends, play moves into the action phase. During the action phase, you and any passengers with you on your mount or vehicle can take one action (except the Dash action) and one additional action for each Angle you created during the stunt phase. Passengers can also move about their vehicles, such as the deck of an airship, but pilots, mounts, and vehicles have used their movement during the stunt phase.</p><p>If you're a pilot, you can use an action to allow your mount or vehicle to take an action. This differs from how mounted combat works on the ground, chiefly because while airborne, you're not using a movement speed or measuring distance in feet, both of which the core mounted combat rules heavily rely on.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"171\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranged Attacks and Melee Attacks</span></h3> <p>Ranged attacks and spells dominate in aerial combat. When you create an Angle, you can assume that you are putting yourself at an optimal distance to make any ranged attack you like.</p><p>Melee weapons can be used so long as your Altitude dice matches your targets. If your weapon has the reach property, you can also make melee attacks against a target one point of Altitude away. Note that the normal Altitude rules for advantage and disadvantage still apply to reach weapons!</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"172\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Taking Damage</span></h3> <p>Whenever you, your mount, or your vehicle is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw and takes damage as a result, decrement your Altitude by 1. Losing Altitude to damage can only occur once per turn.22 Note that this says once per turn, not once per round. For instance, each party member gets a chance to take the wyvern down a peg, but only once!</p><p>Damage is typically applied to a mount or vehicle first, because it's a much bigger target to hit in the midst of the chaos. A GM is free to rule that pilots and passengers can be directly targeted by attacks, potentially with disadvantage.</p><p>If your vehicle or mount is reduced to 0 hit points and you don't have a flying speed, you and any passengers without a flying speed begin Freefalling (see below).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"173\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Going Down</span></h3> <p>While reduced to less than half your hit points, you're Going Down, and your Altitude decreases by 1 at the end of each of your turns, no matter what.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"174\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Direct Hit</span></h3> <p>When you score a critical hit on an attack, it's a direct hit! The target rolls a d4, and drops that many points of Altitude immediately.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"175\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Knife-Fighting in a Phone Booth</span></h3> <p><i>The barbs of a grapnel bite into your hull! Two dragons lock onto each other with glittering jaws and teeth!</i></p><p>Sometimes things get really up close and personal. When you want to grapple a target, it works as usual; in place of a melee attack. A GM might rule that grappling is necessary for a boarding action, if vehicles are involved!</p><p>It's up to the GM to decide whether or not grappling an opponent makes you both start Freefalling. A griffon grappling a pegasus might be grounds for such a ruling, but an airship firing a grappling hook probably wouldn't!</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"176\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bugging Out</span></h3> <p>Sometimes you bite off more than you can chew—we've all been there—but how do you escape a foe that's got you out maneuvered in the air?

You always take 20d6 bludgeoning damage when you hit the ground, because you're usually falling from extreme heights. A combatant flies so fast that touching the ground at all, outside of a controlled landing, is likely to spell disaster. Of course, a GM is free to rule that falling from Low Altitude deals less damage—something like 10d6, or 5d6—but these rulings should be made on instinct to keep the action moving!</p><p>This damage is applied to your mount or vehicle first if you have one (because they hit the ground first!), and leftover damage is then applied to you and your passengers. The pilot and passengers take the same amount of damage; it is not divided between them.</p><p>If this seems harsh, consider the following; falling out of the sky is literally the worst case scenario when committing to aerial combat. Also note that this level of lethality becomes much less pronounced for player characters somewhere between levels 8 and 10, or once they have over 70 hit points total, as they're less likely to suffer instant death.</p><p>Even characters who are basically gods have succumbed to the unyielding wrath of gravity, but that said, those who want a bit of danger at lower levels should embrace it!</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"179\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How Fast Do Things Fall?</span></h3> <p>Good question!

In order to do this, an ally must have a lower Altitude than you, and then must use an action to make a Flight check and snatch you from the jaws of death. The DC for this check is up to the GM, and could depend on how fast you are falling, how close to the ground you are, and even whether or not you need to be plucked from the deck of a failing airship!</p><p>A GM could also use the speed at which a creature or vehicle is falling to help determine how much Freefall damage they take if no one is able to rescue them.

As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.

Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare.

If a lower-level spell that you cast, like @spell[burning hands], has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.</p><p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3. you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\"

{"name":"Spellcasting","pages":[{"name":"Spellcasting","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>This section expands on the spellcasting rules presented in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,10\">Player's Handbook</a> and the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>, providing clarifications and new options.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"120\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Perceiving a Caster at Work</span></h2> <p>Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and could easily go unnoticed by someone unaffected by them. As noted in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.</p><p>But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn't matter for the purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.</p><p>If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"121\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Identifying a Spell</span></h2> <p>Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.</p><p>If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check with their reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.</p><p>This Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"122\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Invalid Spell Targets</span></h2> <p>A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any type of creature, a creature of a certain type (humanoid or beast, for instance), an object, an area, the caster, or something else. But what happens if a spell targets something that isn't a valid target? For example, someone might cast @spell[charm person] on a creature believed to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using the following rule.</p><p>If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"123\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Areas of Effect on a Grid</span></h2> <p>The Dungeon Master's Guide includes the following short rule for using areas of effect on a grid.</p><p>Choose an intersection of squares as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow the rules for that kind of area as normal (see the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,10,areas%20of%20effect,0\">Areas of Effect</a>\" section in chapter 10 of the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>). If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that square.</p><p>That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alternatives for determining the exact location of an area: the template method and the token method. Both of these methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of some sort. Because these methods can yield different results for the number of squares in a given area, it's not recommended that they be combined at the table—choose whichever method you and your players find easier or more intuitive.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"124\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Template Method</span></h3> <p>The template method uses two-dimensional shapes that represent different areas of effect. The aim of the method is to accurately portray the length and width of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt about which creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make these templates or find premade ones.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"125\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Making a Template.</span></span> <p>Making a template is simple. Get a piece of paper or card stock, and cut it in the shape of the area of effect you're using. Every 5 feet of the area equals 1 inch of the template's size. For example, the 20-foot-radius sphere of the @spell[fireball] spell, which has a 40-foot diameter, would translate into a circular template with an 8-inch diameter.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"126\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using a Template.</span></span> <p>To use an area-of-effect template, apply it to the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on the surface; otherwise, hold the template above the surface and take note of which squares it covers or partially covers. If any part of a square is under the template, that square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's miniature is in an affected square, that creature is in the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>You can also use this method without a grid. If you do so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.</p><p>When you place a template, follow all the rules in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for placing the associated area of effect. If an area of effect, such as a cone or a line, originates from a spellcaster, the template should extend out from the caster and be positioned however the caster likes within the bounds of the rules.</p><p>Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2 show the template method in action.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/001.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/001.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"127\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Token Method</span></h3> <p>The token method is meant to make areas of effect tactile and fun. To use this method, grab some dice or other tokens, which you're going to use to represent your areas of effect.</p><p>Rather than faithfully representing the shapes of the different areas of effect, this method gives you a way to create square-edged versions of them on a grid easily, as described in the following subsections.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"128\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Tokens.</span></span> <p>Every 5-foot square of an area of effect becomes a die or other token that you place on the grid. Each token goes inside a square, not at an intersection of lines. If an area's token is in a square, that square is included in the area of effect. It's that simple.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Diagrams 2.3 through 2.6 show this method in action, using dice as the tokens.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/002.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/002.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/003.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/003.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"129\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Circles.</span></span> <p>This method depicts everything using squares, and a circular area of effect becomes square in it, whether the area is a sphere, cylinder, or radius. For instance, the 10-foot radius of flame strike, which has a diameter of 20 feet, is expressed as a square that is 20 feet on a side, as shown in diagram 2.3. Diagram 2.4 shows that area with total cover inside it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"130\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cones.</span></span> <p>A cone is represented by rows of tokens on the grid, extending from the cone's point of origin. In the rows, the squares are adjoining side by side or corner to corner, as shown in diagram 2.5. To determine the number of rows a cone contains, divide its length by 5. For example, a 30-foot cone contains six rows.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Here's how to create the rows. Starting with a square adjacent to the cone's point of origin, place one token. The square can be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the point of origin. In every row beyond that one, place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, plus one more token. Place this row's tokens so that their squares each share a side with a square in the previous row. If the cone is orthogonally adjacent to the point of origin, you'll have one more token to place in the row; place it on one end or the other of the row you just created (you don't have to pick the side chosen in diagram 2.5). Keep placing tokens in this way until you've created all of the cone's rows.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"131\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lines.</span></span> <p>A line can extend from its source orthogonally or diagonally, as shown in diagram 2.6.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"WdlbgGjKicZ9GDmB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"XGE","hash":"spellcasting_xge"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1668004736807,"modifiedTime":1668004736807,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"POVT8kOSttfGXUKR"}

A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.</p><p>A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts.

Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.</p><p>Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.</p><p>Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.</p><p>Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.</p><p>Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.</p><p>You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.</p><p>Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.</p><p>Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.</p><p>The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.</p><p>At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit—only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Complications</span></h3> <p>Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town.

Each character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos.

A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.</p><p>Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) score of 15 or higher.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"118\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sleeping in Armor</span></h2> <p>Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.</p><p>When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die).

For example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a horrid beast.</p><p>A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get feedback before settling on a plot development.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"100\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Option 2: The Plot Thickens</span></h3> <p>Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a complication to the scene. For example, if the player who spends the plot point decides that her character has found a secret door, the player to the right might state that opening the door triggers a magical trap that teleports the party to another part of the dungeon.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"101\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Option 3: The Gods Must Be Crazy</span></h3> <p>With this approach, there is no permanent DM. Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.</p><p>At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.</p><p>Using plot points in this way can make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, controlled doses.</p><p>In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose to not spend a plot point that session.</p><p>For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign so that DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each other's plans.</p></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"QLDFoApcbjHZFxOC","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"DMG","hash":"plot%20points_dmg"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1668004736638,"modifiedTime":1668004736638,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"iU4RJeHex4tTkrZr"}

{"name":"Downtime Revisited","pages":[{"name":"Downtime Revisited","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><p>It's possible for the characters to start a campaign at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short amount of game time. Although that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign story with pauses built into it—times when adventurers are not going on adventures. The downtime rules given in this section can be used as alternatives to the approach in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,8,downtime%20activities,0\">Player's Handbook</a> and the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,6,downtime%20activities,0\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>, or you can use the material here to inspire the creation of your own options.</p><p>By engaging the characters in downtime activities that take weeks or even months to complete, you can give your campaign a longer time line—one in which events in the world play out over years. Wars begin and end, tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the course of the story that you and the characters tell.</p><p>Downtime rules also provide ways for characters to spend—or be relieved of—the monetary treasure they amass on their adventures.</p><p>The system presented here consists of two elements. First, it introduces the concept of rivals. Second, it details a number of downtime activities that characters can undertake.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"39\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rivals</span></h2> <p>Rivals are NPCs who oppose the characters and make their presence felt whenever the characters are engaging in downtime. A rival might be a villain you have featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. Rivals can also include good or neutral folk who are at odds with the characters, whether because they have opposing goals or they simply dislike one another. The cultist of Orcus whose plans the characters have foiled, the ambitious merchant prince who wants to rule the city with an iron fist, and the nosy high priest of Helm who is convinced the characters are up to no good are all examples of rivals.</p><p>A rival's agenda changes over time. Though the characters engage in downtime only between adventures, their rivals rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work against the characters even when the characters are off doing something else.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"40\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rival</span></h3> <p>In essence, a rival is a somewhat specialized NPC. You can use chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to build a new NPC for this purpose, or pick one from your current cast of supporting characters and embellish that NPC as described below.</p><p>It's possible for the characters to have two or three rivals at a time, each with a separate agenda. At least one should be a villain, but the others might be neutral or good; conflicts with those rivals might be social or political, rather than manifesting as direct attacks.</p><p>The best rivals have a connection with their adversaries on a personal level. Find links in the characters' backstories or the events of recent adventures that explain what sparked the rival's actions.

Think about what the rival wants, how and why the characters stand in the way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Ideally, a rival's goal directly involves the characters or something they care about.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"42\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Assets.</span></span> <p>Think about the resources the rival can marshal. Does the character have enough money to pay bribes or to hire a small gang of mercenaries? Does the rival hold sway over any guilds, temples, or other groups? Make a list of the rival's assets, and consider how they can be used.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"43\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Plans.</span></span> <p>The foundation of a rival's presence in the campaign is the actions the rival takes or the events that occur as a result of that character's goals. Each time you resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one of the ways a rival's plans might be advanced and introduce it into play.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Think about how a rival might operate in order to bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or four kinds of actions the rival might undertake. Some of these might be versions of the downtime activities described later in this section, but these are more often efforts that are specific to the rival.</p><p>A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you play out during a session. Or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a rival who wants to increase the prestige of the temple of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly involved, the event becomes the talk of the town.</p><p>Some elements of a rival's plans might involve events in the world that aren't under the rival's control. Whether such an event can be easily anticipated or not, the rival's plans might include contingencies for taking advantage of such happenings.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"44\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Downtime Activities</span></h2> <p>Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (5 days) or longer to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.</p><p>Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, you could have the players pick their downtime activities at the end of a session, and then communicate about them by email or text, until you next see them in person.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"45\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Resolving Activities</span></h3> <p>The description of each activity tells you how to resolve it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to note the character's relevant ability modifiers. Follow the steps in the activity, and determine the results.</p><p>Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days), or months (30 days). A character must spend at least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion.</p><p>The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period of time should be no more than twice as long as the required time; otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see below) and possibly double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"46\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Complications</span></h3> <p>The description of each activity includes a discussion of complications you can throw at the characters. The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the characters headaches or advantages in any number of other ways.</p><p>Each of these sections has a table that offers possible complications. You can roll to determine a complication randomly, pick one from the table, or devise one of your own, and then share it with the player.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"47\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Example Downtime Activities</span></h2> <p>The following activities are suitable for any character who can afford to pursue them. As DM, you have the final say on which activities are available to the characters. The activities you allow might depend on the nature of the area where the characters are located. For example, you might disallow the creation of magic items or decide that the characters are in a town that is too isolated from major markets for them to buy such items.</p><p>See the following entries for details:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Buying a Magic Item|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Carousing|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Crafting an Item|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Crime|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Gambling|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Pit Fighting|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Relaxation|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Religious Service|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Research|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Scribing a Spell Scroll|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Selling a Magic Item|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Training|XGE]</li><li class=\"rd__li \">@variantrule[Downtime Activity: Work|XGE]</li></ul></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"HmivMtejWDQBQJYt","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"XGE","hash":"downtime%20revisited_xge"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1668004736118,"modifiedTime":1668004736118,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"ugroSL05xhdPAWrL"}

You can reflect this dissonance with this optional rule. At the end of a long rest spent on an incompatible plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of @condition[exhaustion]. Incompatibility between lawful and chaotic alignments doesn't have the same effect, so Mechanus and Limbo lack this quality.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"75\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mount Celestia: Blessed Beneficence</span></h2> <p>In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of good alignment gain the benefit of the @spell[bless] spell as long as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a @spell[lesser restoration] spell.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"76\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bytopia: Pervasive Goodwill</span></h2> <p>At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful good or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature's current alignment). The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within [[/r 1d4]] days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. Casting the @spell[dispel evil and good] spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"77\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elysium: Overwhelming Joy</span></h2> <p>Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave the plane before taking another long rest. After three failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its power to return to the plane. A @spell[dispel evil and good] spell removes this effect from the creature.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"78\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Beastlands: Hunter's Paradise</span></h2> <p>Visitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and stalking capabilities improved, and characters have advantage on Wisdom (@skill[Animal Handling]), Wisdom (@skill[Perception]), and Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) checks while there.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"79\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Beastlands: Beast Transformation</span></h2> <p>Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become transformed (as the @spell[polymorph] spell) into the type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws. the transformation can be undone only by a @spell[remove curse] spell or similar magic. </p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"80\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arborea: Intense Yearning</span></h2> <p>Keep track of how many days a visitor spends on Arborea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for each day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the effect persists the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A @spell[dispel evil and good] spell removes this effect from the creature.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"81\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ysgard: Immortal Wrath</span></h2> <p>Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death are removed.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"82\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Limbo: Power of the Mind</span></h2> <p>As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it beat the DC.</p><p>A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire.</p><p>Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5.

On a failed save, the creature gains one level of @condition[exhaustion]. A creature that reaches six levels of @condition[exhaustion] while on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, \"Running the Game.\" Finishing a long rest doesn't reduce a creature's @condition[exhaustion] level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"84\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Abyss: Abyssal Corruption</span></h2> <p>A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.</p><p>After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the corruption effect ends. A @spell[dispel evil and good] spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect.</p><p>If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within [[/r 1d4 + 2]] days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil.

On a failed save, the creature gains one level of @condition[exhaustion], which can't be removed while the creature remains in Hades. If the creature reaches six levels of @condition[exhaustion], it doesn't die. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into a larva, whereupon all levels of @condition[exhaustion] afflicting the creature are removed.</p><p>A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial features of its previous form but has the body of a fat worm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its previous life and the statistics in the @creature[larva|dmg] stat block. Hades is crawling with larvae.

Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails, the spell slot is expended, and the action is wasted.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"88\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Nine Hells: Pervasive Evil</span></h2> <p>Evil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn't evil must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within [[/r 1d4]] days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the Nine Hells.

These rules take a creature with a low challenge rating and give it levels in one of three simple classes: Expert, Spellcaster, or Warrior.</p><p>A sidekick can be incorporated into a group at the party's inception, or a sidekick might join them during the campaign. For example, the characters might meet a villager, an animal, or another creature, forge a friendship, and invite the creature to join them on their adventures.</p><p>You can also use these rules to customize a monster for your own use as DM.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"110\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Sidekick</span></h2> <p>A sidekick can be any type of creature with a stat block in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#MM\">Monster Manual</a> or another D&amp;D book, but the challenge rating in its stat block must be <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/bestiary.html#blankhash,flstchallenge%20rating:min=&amp;0~max=&amp;1/2,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2\">½ or lower</a>. You take that stat block and add to it, as explained in the \"Gaining a Sidekick Class\" section.</p><p>To join the adventurers, the sidekick must be the friend of at least one of them. This friendship might be connected to a character's backstory or to events that have transpired in play. For example, a sidekick could be a childhood friend or pet, or it might be a creature the adventurers saved. As DM, you determine whether there is sufficient trust established for the creature to join the group.</p><p>You decide who plays the sidekick. Here are some options:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">A player plays the sidekick as their second character-ideal when you have only one or two players.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A player plays the sidekick as their only character-ideal for a player who wants a character who's simpler than a typical player character.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The players jointly play the sidekick.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You play the sidekick.</li></ul><p>There's no limit on the number of sidekicks in a group, but having more than one per player character can noticeably slow down the game.

It doesn't matter how much of the group's recent adventures the sidekick experienced; the sidekick levels up because of a combination of the adventures it shared with the group and its own training.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"114\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hit Points</span></h2> <p>Whenever the sidekick gains a level, it gains one Hit Die, and its hit point maximum increases. To determine the amount of the increase, roll the Hit Die (the type of die appears in the sidekick's stat block), and add its Constitution modifier. It gains a minimum of 1 hit point per level.</p><p>If the sidekick drops to 0 hit points and isn't killed outright, it falls @condition[unconscious] and subsequently makes death saving throws, just like a player character.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"115\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Proficiency Bonus</span></h2> <p>The sidekick's proficiency bonus is determined by its level in its class, as shown in the class's table.</p><p>Whenever the sidekick's proficiency bonus increases by 1, add 1 to the to-hit modifier of all the attacks in its stat block, and increase the DCs in its stat block by 1.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"116\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ability Score Increases</span></h2> <p>Whenever the sidekick gains the Ability Score Improvement feature, adjust anything in its stat block that relies on an ability modifier that you increase. For example, if the sidekick has an attack that uses its Strength modifier, increase the attack's modifiers to hit and damage if the Strength modifier increases.</p><p>If it's unclear whether a melee attack in the stat block uses Strength or Dexterity, the attack can use either.</p></div></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"odiEbuEwP8FBxx0Q","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"TCE","hash":"sidekicks_tce"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1668004736716,"modifiedTime":1668004736716,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"zy4NkwpQds2jByJc"}
