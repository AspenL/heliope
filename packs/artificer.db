It has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the @spell[mending] spell is cast on it, it regains [[/r 2d6]] hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 10 minutes. You can dismiss it early as an action.</p><p>When you summon the turret, you decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Arcane Turrets table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the turret to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same action, you can direct the turret to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space.</p><p>You can summon a turret once for free and must finish a long rest before doing so again. You can also summon the turret by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher. If you summon a second turret, the first turret disappears.</p><p>As an action, you can command your turret to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the turret and forces each creature within 10 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking [[/r 3d6]] force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Arcane Turrets</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Turret</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Activation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2\">Flamethrower</td><td class=\"col-10\">The turret exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate.

Whenever you finish a long rest and your @item[woodcarver's tools|phb] are with you, you can touch a nonmagical, wooden wand and turn it into a magic item. When you do so, you invest it with one artificer cantrip of your choice—even one you don't know—that has a casting time of 1 action. As an action, you can cause the magic wand to produce the cantrip, using your spellcasting ability modifier (other creatures are unable to use the wand's magic). The wand loses this magic when you finish your next long rest.</p><p>Any damage roll you make for a cantrip in the wand gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</p><p>When you reach 14th level in this class, you can invest the wand with two cantrips at the end of a long rest.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div data-source=\"UAArtificerRevisited\" class=\"rd__b spicy-sauce rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2098\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Fortified Position</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Unearthed Arcana: Artificer Revisited\">UAAR</span> p9</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Starting at 14th level, you're a master at conjuring a well-defended emplacement.
