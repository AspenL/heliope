Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.</p><p>Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.</p><p>Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.</p><p>Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.</p><p>Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.</p><p>You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.</p><p>Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.</p><p>Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.</p><p>The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.</p><p>At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit—only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3821\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Complications</span></h3> <p>Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town.

Although that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign story with pauses built into it—times when adventurers are not going on adventures. The downtime rules given in this section can be used as alternatives to the approach in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,8,downtime%20activities,0\">Player's Handbook</a> and the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG,6,downtime%20activities,0\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>, or you can use the material here to inspire the creation of your own options.</p><p>By engaging the characters in downtime activities that take weeks or even months to complete, you can give your campaign a longer time line—one in which events in the world play out over years. Wars begin and end, tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall over the course of the story that you and the characters tell.</p><p>Downtime rules also provide ways for characters to spend—or be relieved of—the monetary treasure they amass on their adventures.</p><p>The system presented here consists of two elements. First, it introduces the concept of rivals. Second, it details a number of downtime activities that characters can undertake.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3854\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rivals</span></h2> <p>Rivals are NPCs who oppose the characters and make their presence felt whenever the characters are engaging in downtime. A rival might be a villain you have featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. Rivals can also include good or neutral folk who are at odds with the characters, whether because they have opposing goals or they simply dislike one another. The cultist of Orcus whose plans the characters have foiled, the ambitious merchant prince who wants to rule the city with an iron fist, and the nosy high priest of Helm who is convinced the characters are up to no good are all examples of rivals.</p><p>A rival's agenda changes over time. Though the characters engage in downtime only between adventures, their rivals rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work against the characters even when the characters are off doing something else.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3855\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Rival</span></h3> <p>In essence, a rival is a somewhat specialized NPC. You can use chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to build a new NPC for this purpose, or pick one from your current cast of supporting characters and embellish that NPC as described below.</p><p>It's possible for the characters to have two or three rivals at a time, each with a separate agenda. At least one should be a villain, but the others might be neutral or good; conflicts with those rivals might be social or political, rather than manifesting as direct attacks.</p><p>The best rivals have a connection with their adversaries on a personal level. Find links in the characters' backstories or the events of recent adventures that explain what sparked the rival's actions. The best trouble to put the characters in is trouble they created for themselves.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Rival</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Rival</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\">Tax collector who is convinced the characters are dodging fees</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"col-10\">Politician who is concerned that the characters are causing more trouble than they solve</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"col-10\">High priest who worries the characters are diminishing the temple's prestige</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"col-10\">Wizard who blames the characters for some recent troubles</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td><td class=\"col-10\">Rival adventuring party</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td><td class=\"col-10\">Bard who loves a scandal enough to spark one</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td><td class=\"col-10\">Childhood rival or member of a rival clan</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\">8</td><td class=\"col-10\">Scorned sibling or parent</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"9\" data-roll-max=\"9\">9</td><td class=\"col-10\">Merchant who blames the characters for any business woes</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"10\" data-roll-max=\"10\">10</td><td class=\"col-10\">Newcomer out to make a mark on the world</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"11\" data-roll-max=\"11\">11</td><td class=\"col-10\">Sibling or ally of defeated enemy</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"12\" data-roll-max=\"12\">12</td><td class=\"col-10\">Official seeking to restore a tarnished reputation</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"13\" data-roll-max=\"13\">13</td><td class=\"col-10\">Deadly foe disguised as a social rival</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"14\" data-roll-max=\"14\">14</td><td class=\"col-10\">Fiend seeking to tempt the characters to evil</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"15\" data-roll-max=\"15\">15</td><td class=\"col-10\">Spurned romantic interest</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"16\" data-roll-max=\"16\">16</td><td class=\"col-10\">Political opportunist seeking a scapegoat</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"17\" data-roll-max=\"17\">17</td><td class=\"col-10\">Traitorous noble looking to foment a revolution</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"18\" data-roll-max=\"18\">18</td><td class=\"col-10\">Would-be tyrant who brooks no opposition</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"19\" data-roll-max=\"19\">19</td><td class=\"col-10\">Exiled noble looking for revenge</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"20\" data-roll-max=\"20\">20</td><td class=\"col-10\">Corrupt official worried that recent misdeeds will be revealed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To add the right amount of detail to a rival you want to create, give some thought to what that NPC is trying to accomplish and what resources and methods the rival can bring to bear against the characters.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3856\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goals.</span></span> <p>An effective rival has a clear reason for interfering with the characters' lives. Think about what the rival wants, how and why the characters stand in the way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Ideally, a rival's goal directly involves the characters or something they care about.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3857\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Assets.</span></span> <p>Think about the resources the rival can marshal. Does the character have enough money to pay bribes or to hire a small gang of mercenaries? Does the rival hold sway over any guilds, temples, or other groups? Make a list of the rival's assets, and consider how they can be used.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3858\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Plans.</span></span> <p>The foundation of a rival's presence in the campaign is the actions the rival takes or the events that occur as a result of that character's goals. Each time you resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one of the ways a rival's plans might be advanced and introduce it into play.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Think about how a rival might operate in order to bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or four kinds of actions the rival might undertake. Some of these might be versions of the downtime activities described later in this section, but these are more often efforts that are specific to the rival.</p><p>A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you play out during a session. Or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a rival who wants to increase the prestige of the temple of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly involved, the event becomes the talk of the town.</p><p>Some elements of a rival's plans might involve events in the world that aren't under the rival's control. Whether such an event can be easily anticipated or not, the rival's plans might include contingencies for taking advantage of such happenings.</p></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3859\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Downtime Activities</span></h2> <p>Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (5 days) or longer to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.</p><p>Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, you could have the players pick their downtime activities at the end of a session, and then communicate about them by email or text, until you next see them in person.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3860\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Resolving Activities</span></h3> <p>The description of each activity tells you how to resolve it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to note the character's relevant ability modifiers. Follow the steps in the activity, and determine the results.</p><p>Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days), or months (30 days). A character must spend at least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion.</p><p>The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period of time should be no more than twice as long as the required time; otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see below) and possibly double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3861\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Complications</span></h3> <p>The description of each activity includes a discussion of complications you can throw at the characters. The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the characters headaches or advantages in any number of other ways.</p><p>Each of these sections has a table that offers possible complications. You can roll to determine a complication randomly, pick one from the table, or devise one of your own, and then share it with the player.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3862\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Example Downtime Activities</span></h2> <p>The following activities are suitable for any character who can afford to pursue them. As DM, you have the final say on which activities are available to the characters. The activities you allow might depend on the nature of the area where the characters are located.

{"name":"Inspiration","pages":[{"name":"Inspiration","type":"text","text":{"format":1,"content":"<div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>, having inspiration gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more than one inspiration at a time.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3868\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Awarding Inspiration</span></h3> <p>Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of the game. If you take away anything from this section, remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that make the game more exciting, amusing, or memorable.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each character about once per session of play. Over time, you might want to award inspiration more or less often, at a rate that works best for your table. You might use the same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might change it with each campaign.</p><p>Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make the game more fun for your group? What type of action fit in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answer to those questions help determine when you award inspiration.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3869\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying.</span></span> <p>Using inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do something that is consistent with the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character's action should be notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and try not to favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his character's attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3870\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Heroism.</span></span> <p>You can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to embrace swashbuckling action.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a [[/r d20]] roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a cushion against failure—and a guarantee that it comes into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3871\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Reward for Victory.</span></span> <p>Some DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires a DM's judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence and energy.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the campaign.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3872\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Genre Emulation.</span></span> <p>Inspiration is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: \"I can 't resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble.\" If the characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they shouldn't. If the party splits up, consider giving each character inspiration.</p><p>A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre's main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing those conventions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3873\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Players and Inspiration.</span></span> <p>Remember that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's best to let players award their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce conventions of a certain genre.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3874\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">When Do You Award Inspiration</span></h3> <p>Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means players don't know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they want.</p><p>Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling tale together.</p><p>Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you are being manipulative.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3875\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tracking Inspiration</span></h3> <p>A player typically notes on a character sheet whether he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or some other token. Alternatively, you can hand out special d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to someone else, the [[/r d20]] can go to that other person.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3876\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ignoring Inspiration</span></h3> <p>Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don't need incentives like inspiration.</p><p>If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rules arbiter.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3877\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Only Players Award Inspiration</span></h3> <p>As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding inspiration.</p><p>This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.</p><p>This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or whatever other criteria the group has established.</p><p>In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give advantage to any foe of the player characters. There's no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration carries over from one session to the next.</p></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"PxePp1uY4kqoJFcB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"DMG","hash":"inspiration_dmg"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.","hash":"e43e4673a83efb7923992aa68c87b10935ba70e6"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1682006857988,"modifiedTime":1682006857988,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"JzXkBA4MhfPkPfSc"}

If a lower-level spell that you cast, like @spell[burning hands], has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.</p><p>For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3. you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells.

You can choose to add effects to any or all of the planes, to better represent their uniqueness. The effects listed below apply to the default cosmological arrangement presented in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,13\">Player's Handbook</a>, and are individually optional.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3893\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feywild: Feywild Magic</span></h2> <p>Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their parents years later without having aged a day, and with no memories of their captors or the realm they came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover upon their return that time flows differently on the Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the strange magic that suffuses the plane.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3894\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Memory Loss</span></h3> <p>A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's lost memories.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3895\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Time Warp</span></h3> <p>While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed everywhere else in the multiverse.</p><p>Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp table. A @spell[wish] spell can be used to remove the effect on up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability to grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries agree to subject themselves to a @spell[geas] spell and complete a quest after the @spell[wish] spell is cast.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Feywild Time Warp</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center no-wrap\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center no-wrap\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"2\">1-2</td><td class=\"col-10\">Days become minutes</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center no-wrap\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"6\">3-6</td><td class=\"col-10\">Days become hours</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center no-wrap\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"13\">7-13</td><td class=\"col-10\">No change</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center no-wrap\" data-roll-min=\"14\" data-roll-max=\"17\">14-17</td><td class=\"col-10\">Days become weeks</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center no-wrap\" data-roll-min=\"18\" data-roll-max=\"19\">18-19</td><td class=\"col-10\">Days become months</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center no-wrap\" data-roll-min=\"20\" data-roll-max=\"20\">20</td><td class=\"col-10\">Days become years</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3896\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Shadowfell: Shadowfell Despair</span></h2> <p>A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell. Extended forays to this plane can afflict characters with despair, as reflected in this optional rule.</p><p>When you deem it appropriate, though usually not more than once per day, you can require a character not native to the Shadowfell to make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the character is affected by despair. Roll a [[/r d6]] to determine the effects, using the Shadowfell Despair table.

After finishing a long rest, a character can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) On a successful save, the despair effect ends for that character.</p><p>A @spell[calm emotions] spell removes despair, as does any spell or other magical effect that removes a curse.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3897\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Outer Planes: Psychic Dissonance</span></h2> <p>Each of the Outer Planes emanates a psychic dissonance that affects visitors of an incompatible alignment—good creatures on the Lower Planes, evil ones on the Upper Planes—if they spend too much time on the plane. You can reflect this dissonance with this optional rule. At the end of a long rest spent on an incompatible plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of @condition[exhaustion]. Incompatibility between lawful and chaotic alignments doesn't have the same effect, so Mechanus and Limbo lack this quality.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3898\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Mount Celestia: Blessed Beneficence</span></h2> <p>In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of good alignment gain the benefit of the @spell[bless] spell as long as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a @spell[lesser restoration] spell.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3899\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bytopia: Pervasive Goodwill</span></h2> <p>At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful good or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature's current alignment). The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within [[/r 1d4]] days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. Casting the @spell[dispel evil and good] spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3900\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elysium: Overwhelming Joy</span></h2> <p>Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave the plane before taking another long rest. After three failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its power to return to the plane. A @spell[dispel evil and good] spell removes this effect from the creature.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3901\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Beastlands: Hunter's Paradise</span></h2> <p>Visitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and stalking capabilities improved, and characters have advantage on Wisdom (@skill[Animal Handling]), Wisdom (@skill[Perception]), and Wisdom (@skill[Survival]) checks while there.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3902\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Beastlands: Beast Transformation</span></h2> <p>Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become transformed (as the @spell[polymorph] spell) into the type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws. the transformation can be undone only by a @spell[remove curse] spell or similar magic. </p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3903\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arborea: Intense Yearning</span></h2> <p>Keep track of how many days a visitor spends on Arborea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for each day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the effect persists the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A @spell[dispel evil and good] spell removes this effect from the creature.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3904\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ysgard: Immortal Wrath</span></h2> <p>Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death are removed.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3905\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Limbo: Power of the Mind</span></h2> <p>As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it beat the DC.</p><p>A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire.</p><p>Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or until the creature uses this ability again.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3906\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Pandemonium: Mad Winds</span></h2> <p>A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of @condition[exhaustion]. A creature that reaches six levels of @condition[exhaustion] while on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, \"Running the Game.\" Finishing a long rest doesn't reduce a creature's @condition[exhaustion] level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3907\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Abyss: Abyssal Corruption</span></h2> <p>A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.</p><p>After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw.

During a session, a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect depends on your group's approach to this optional rule. Three options are presented below.</p><p>A player can spend no more than 1 plot point per session. You can increase this limit if you like, especially if you want the players to drive more of the story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot point, they each gain 1 plot point.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3922\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Option 1: What a Twist!</span></h3> <p>A player who spends a plot point gets to add some element to the setting or situation that the group (including you) must accept as true. For example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a horrid beast.</p><p>A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get feedback before settling on a plot development.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3923\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Option 2: The Plot Thickens</span></h3> <p>Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a complication to the scene. For example, if the player who spends the plot point decides that her character has found a secret door, the player to the right might state that opening the door triggers a magical trap that teleports the party to another part of the dungeon.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3924\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Option 3: The Gods Must Be Crazy</span></h3> <p>With this approach, there is no permanent DM. Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.</p><p>At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.</p><p>Using plot points in this way can make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, controlled doses.</p><p>In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose to not spend a plot point that session.</p><p>For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign so that DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each other's plans.</p></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"IDmSgRj0nioFtUJM","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"DMG","hash":"plot%20points_dmg"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.","hash":"fca40831233bf8f2f197ee84783b1ac165aa1df6"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1682006858227,"modifiedTime":1682006858227,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"ITtWzx4FZ0hb00pF"}

Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources.</p><p>A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of.

You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.</p><p>Advancing an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character's renown by 2 instead.</p><p>For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies.</p><p>Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent.

For example, members of the Emerald Enclave—a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order—might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave.

It's a great option for campaigns where the gods take active roles in the world.</p><p>Using this approach, you track renown based on specific divine figures in your campaign. Each character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos. A character loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims.</p><p>The gods bestow favors on those who prove their devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a spell accompanied by the boom of thunder.</p><p>A high level of piety can also lead to a character gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a blessing or charm (see chapter 7, \"Treasure,\" for such supernatural gifts).</p></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"6vINYJ6M83blTmHv","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"DMG","hash":"renown_dmg"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.","hash":"d93bdd8d62bb04e4dcdf7ef0355ba16ed6521ef8"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1682006858264,"modifiedTime":1682006858264,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"KKcmGv0KezyN64ys"}

Other spells, such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and could easily go unnoticed by someone unaffected by them. As noted in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.</p><p>But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn't matter for the purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.</p><p>If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3934\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Identifying a Spell</span></h2> <p>Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.</p><p>If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check with their reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.</p><p>This Intelligence (@skill[Arcana]) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3935\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Invalid Spell Targets</span></h2> <p>A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any type of creature, a creature of a certain type (humanoid or beast, for instance), an object, an area, the caster, or something else. But what happens if a spell targets something that isn't a valid target? For example, someone might cast @spell[charm person] on a creature believed to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using the following rule.</p><p>If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3936\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Areas of Effect on a Grid</span></h2> <p>The Dungeon Master's Guide includes the following short rule for using areas of effect on a grid.</p><p>Choose an intersection of squares as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow the rules for that kind of area as normal (see the \"<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB,10,areas%20of%20effect,0\">Areas of Effect</a>\" section in chapter 10 of the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a>). If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that square.</p><p>That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alternatives for determining the exact location of an area: the template method and the token method. Both of these methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of some sort. Because these methods can yield different results for the number of squares in a given area, it's not recommended that they be combined at the table—choose whichever method you and your players find easier or more intuitive.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3937\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Template Method</span></h3> <p>The template method uses two-dimensional shapes that represent different areas of effect. The aim of the method is to accurately portray the length and width of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt about which creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make these templates or find premade ones.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3938\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Making a Template.</span></span> <p>Making a template is simple. Get a piece of paper or card stock, and cut it in the shape of the area of effect you're using. Every 5 feet of the area equals 1 inch of the template's size. For example, the 20-foot-radius sphere of the @spell[fireball] spell, which has a 40-foot diameter, would translate into a circular template with an 8-inch diameter.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3939\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using a Template.</span></span> <p>To use an area-of-effect template, apply it to the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on the surface; otherwise, hold the template above the surface and take note of which squares it covers or partially covers. If any part of a square is under the template, that square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's miniature is in an affected square, that creature is in the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>You can also use this method without a grid. If you do so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.</p><p>When you place a template, follow all the rules in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#PHB\">Player's Handbook</a> for placing the associated area of effect. If an area of effect, such as a cone or a line, originates from a spellcaster, the template should extend out from the caster and be positioned however the caster likes within the bounds of the rules.</p><p>Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2 show the template method in action.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/001.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/001.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3940\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Token Method</span></h3> <p>The token method is meant to make areas of effect tactile and fun. To use this method, grab some dice or other tokens, which you're going to use to represent your areas of effect.</p><p>Rather than faithfully representing the shapes of the different areas of effect, this method gives you a way to create square-edged versions of them on a grid easily, as described in the following subsections.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3941\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using Tokens.</span></span> <p>Every 5-foot square of an area of effect becomes a die or other token that you place on the grid. Each token goes inside a square, not at an intersection of lines. If an area's token is in a square, that square is included in the area of effect. It's that simple.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Diagrams 2.3 through 2.6 show this method in action, using dice as the tokens.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/002.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/002.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/003.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/variantrules/003.png\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div></div><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3942\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Circles.</span></span> <p>This method depicts everything using squares, and a circular area of effect becomes square in it, whether the area is a sphere, cylinder, or radius. For instance, the 10-foot radius of flame strike, which has a diameter of 20 feet, is expressed as a square that is 20 feet on a side, as shown in diagram 2.3. Diagram 2.4 shows that area with total cover inside it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3943\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cones.</span></span> <p>A cone is represented by rows of tokens on the grid, extending from the cone's point of origin. In the rows, the squares are adjoining side by side or corner to corner, as shown in diagram 2.5. To determine the number of rows a cone contains, divide its length by 5. For example, a 30-foot cone contains six rows.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Here's how to create the rows. Starting with a square adjacent to the cone's point of origin, place one token. The square can be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the point of origin. In every row beyond that one, place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, plus one more token. Place this row's tokens so that their squares each share a side with a square in the previous row. If the cone is orthogonally adjacent to the point of origin, you'll have one more token to place in the row; place it on one end or the other of the row you just created (you don't have to pick the side chosen in diagram 2.5). Keep placing tokens in this way until you've created all of the cone's rows.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3944\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lines.</span></span> <p>A line can extend from its source orthogonally or diagonally, as shown in diagram 2.6.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div></div>"},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_id":"CIkqXkRjHwRyeFbh","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0}],"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"variantrules.html","source":"XGE","hash":"spellcasting_xge"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.","hash":"8f5f24baa4ff6e382f15efaa6191be4e14ec6e41"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1682006858336,"modifiedTime":1682006858336,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"Euis6ZX2tMP8sv1t"}

The greeting serves two purposes.</p><p>The first is as confirmation of visual identification. If an employer's greeting is met with confusion by the stranger, they will know that the individual they've approached is not offering roguish work, simply making a fashion statement.</p><p>Second is as a means of clarifying the type of exchange the approacher is initiating. The tone of the greeting phrase will differentiate between someone looking to hire and someone looking to blend in or for temporary protection in the form of hiding or a falsified alibi. On occasion, when a high alert for suspicious activity is in effect, a kind rogue will warn others of the varied trades to lay low by use of a similar greeting. For example:</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3958\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Offering Work.</span></span> <p>\"Look what the cat dragged in\"; \"Uh oh, here comes trouble\"; greetings suggesting a teasing closeness.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3959\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Requesting Sanctuary.</span></span> <p>\"Aren't you a sight for sore eyes\"; \"Boy, am I glad to see you\"; greetings expressing relief.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3960\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lay Low.</span></span> <p>\"Long time no see\"; \"Feels like I haven't seen you in forever\"; greetings indicating a long period between meetings.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><p>If a rogue requests and is provided sanctuary of any sort by use of the Strange Approach, it is generally regarded that repayment take the form of an owed favour. To demand coin in return for the service of protection is deemed poor taste, and work for such a tradesman would dry up in the city as word got around that they weren't good to work with. For the dishonest, reputation is everything.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3961\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dishonest Employment</span></h2> <p>Once a cant greeting has been accepted, an offer may be floated by the approaching employer, disguised as conversational catching up. This offer will provide the basic outline of the illegal work to be done, allowing those propositioned to decide whether or not they're interested in taking on the job. The type of task to be completed is already assumed based on the advertised speciality of the hiree, so ordinarily this conversation covers:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Whether the contract is personal or on behalf of a syndicate;</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The anticipated difficulty in carrying out the work;</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The amount of payment proposed; and</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A location at which both parties may meet later for further details.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3962\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Catching Up</span></h2> <p>When a greeting is accepted, it is customary for the hiree to enquire as to the employer's wellbeing. From there the employer is obliged to answer that they are either <b><i>\"on my own these days\"</i></b> if the job is for them personally, or <b><i>\"starting a family\"</i></b> or similar if the job is on behalf of a larger group. Some might wish to steer clear of crime family work, for example, or to remain unafiliated with a cause and this could be their only opportunity to turn down the offer of work without causing offense.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3963\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How's Your Dad?</span></h2> <p>The conversation will then move to the general foreseen difficulty of a contract. This will be measured by the health status of a fabricated loved one of the employer. The scale may range from a simple task when the loved one is <b><i>\"well\"</i></b> to a potentially deadly challenge if hey have <b><i>\"passed away\"</i></b>. If the obstacles are unknown, the health of the loved one will be similarly uncertain, <b><i>\"a bit touch and go\"</i></b>.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3964\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Compensation</span></h2> <p>Payment is also usually discussed during this 'catch up', however the onus is on the hiree rogue to ensure such - if an inexperienced thief takes a job without negotiating remuneration and winds up with little reward to show for their efforts, the fault lies with them. Who are they gonna complain to, the guards?</p><p>A discussion of compensation may be brought to the conversation by the introduction of any topic enabling the inconspicuous use of numbers.

Aerial combat doesn't happen a lot in roleplaying games, because it tends to be more cumbersome and less fun than combat on the ground—but in many stories that aren't RPGs, aerial battles happen all the time! The aim of Aces High is to emulate the thrill of those stories, and make you want to put more aerial combat in your games.</p><p>These rules are strictly aimed at combat encounters that take place entirely in the air.

This includes ability checks, called flight checks, and saving throws, called flight saving throws.</p><p>The two factors that determine your flight modifier are size and flying speed, because the flight modifier is based on the real-life concept of the thrust-to-weight ratio. You can find a vehicle or creature's flight modifier on the flight modifiers table on the next page.</p><p>When riding a mount, use the mount's flight modifier. When piloting a vehicle, use the vehicle's flight modifier. When you gain a flying speed, whether through a spell such as fly, or the use of a magic item such as wings of flying, calculate your own flight modifier.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3972\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Pilots and Passengers</span></h2> <p>If you're the helmsman of a vehicle, directing a mount, or flying under your own steam, you're considered a pilot.

data-title-index=\"3973\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Abstract Positions</span></h1> <p>Aces High aims to be fast, simple, and fun. Don't worry about the precise positioning of combatants, the direction they are flying, or their fly speed! You can safely assume that combatants are constantly changing direction while chasing each other, automatically making the best maneuvers they can—the only thing you need to know is whether or not they have a clear shot at each other. Measurements, including altitude (see \"Altitude Die\"), are abstractions when using these rules.</p><p>Using minis can be useful to help visualize the scene, but Aces High doesn't use a grid at all.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"3974\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How to Play</span></h1> <p>While you can defeat an opponent by dealing damage to them, your primary objective in an Aces High encounter is to ground the enemy. Knocking your foes out of the sky is the fastest path to victory!</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3975\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Scramble!</span></h2> <p>When two or more combatants commit to aerial combat, all pilots involved must Scramble!</p><p>Scrambling sets the turn order and the starting altitude of each combatant. Much like standard initiative, combatants roll a d20 and add their flight modifier to the result, with higher results taking their turns first. However, unlike initiative, all combatants have 10 seconds to roll as many times as they want, trying to get the best possible result. Once the timer is up, everyone must use the result they have in front of them!11 Players using an online platform to play are able to roll much faster than normal, so consider cutting the time limit in half when playing online.</p><p>When flying any mount or vehicle, only the pilot needs to Scramble. Passengers don't need to Scramble—they take actions when their pilot does.</p><p>When a new combatant joins (or rejoins!) the fray, they Scramble without a timer, and use the first result they roll.</p><p>To find your opening altitude, don't add your flight modifier; all you need to do is look at the number on your d20, and match it to the corresponding Altitude on the Opening Altitude Table.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3976\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Altitude Die</span></h2> <p>Altitude is vital to both success and survival in an Aces High encounter. We track it on the Altitude Die, a d6 that you can place next to your character sheet or your mini. The higher the number, the higher you are!</p><p>Being above your target is an enormous tactical advantage that allows you to use the sun or other environmental conditions to make tracking your movement extremely difficult. A pilot is too engaged with flying to spend precious seconds craning their neck to squint at the sky! You have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets of a higher Altitude than you, unless you're a passenger.</p><p>As you might expect, this also means you have advantage on attack rolls against targets with an Altitude below yours. This advantage applies whether you're a pilot or a passenger.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Opening Altitude Table</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d20]]</th><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Altitude</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"4\">1-4</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">2</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"8\">5-8</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">3</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"9\" data-roll-max=\"12\">9-12</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">4</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"13\" data-roll-max=\"16\">13-16</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">5</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"17\" data-roll-max=\"20\">17-20</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">6</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3977\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Stunt Phase</span></h2> <p>Once everyone has Scrambled and set their Altitude Die, play begins. On each player's turn there are two phases; the stunt phase—in which you try to create angles of attack, and the action phase—in which you try to use them!</p><p>When your stunt phase starts, you roll a number of d4s equal to your flight modifier (minimum of 1 die). These are your Stunt Dice. You can spend them to alter your Altitude, or spend them to create Angles.</p><p>Unspent dice carry over to the next round. When your next stunt phase starts, roll a new set of d4s, and add them to the pile you had left over.</p><p>Your stunt phase ends when you say it does, or when you have no more Stunt Dice to spend.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3978\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating Angles</span></h3> <p>When you roll your Stunt Dice, the results are somewhat like a hand of cards. To create an Angle, you must match three-of-a-kind, or three-in-a-row. For example, 3-3-3 and 2-3-4 are both viable Angles. When you match and subsequently spend these dice, you gain an extra action to use during the action phase!</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"3979\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Multiple Angles</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p></p><p>If you're fast enough, it's possible to create multiple Angles and therefore access more than the normal amount of actions in one turn, but only the fastest of creatures and vehicles can do this regularly! Generally speaking, it's more likely that a monster that's in their element when flying—like a roc, or a couatl—is going to be fast enough to really bend the action economy, but that's by design; dogfighting a roc should feel like a legendary encounter!</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3980\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adjusting Altitude</span></h3> <p>The other way to spend Stunt Dice during your stunt phase is to adjust your Altitude, either by climbing or diving. In both cases, you spend a Stunt Die and then alter your Altitude by the number on the spent Stunt Die. Climbing increments the Altitude Die, and diving decrements it.</p><p>You can only spend a Stunt Die to adjust your Altitude</p><p>once during your stunt phase.</p><p>When you choose to dive, the potential energy you've stored is transformed into momentum you can use to supercharge your speed! When you decrement your Altitude Die by the result of a spent Stunt Die, you can add that amount as a bonus to one of the following:</p><p>1. Your AC.</p><p>2. Your attack and damage rolls.</p><p>You keep these bonuses until the start of your next turn.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3981\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">High Altitude</span></h3> <p>Climbing above 6 on the Altitude Die means you've passed over into High Altitude. Upgrade your Altitude Die to a d12! For every point of Altitude you have above 6, you gain an extra Stunt Die to roll at the start of your stunt phase. You can't climb above Altitude 12.</p><p>However, any creature that ends its turn in High Altitude must make a Constitution saving throw to withstand the thinning air and plummeting temperature! Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed.</p><p>The DC for a High Altitude Constitution saving throw is the number on your Altitude Die x 2.</p><p>Any creature that fails this saving throw falls unconscious. This may or may not mean you start Freefalling, but it's likely that it does—an unconscious creature cannot fly, and if you're piloting a vehicle, you've probably passed out at the wheel.</p><p>You can repeat this saving throw in order to regain consciousness at the end of each of your turns, but the DC for repeated saving throws remains the same no matter your Altitude.</p><p>See \"Freefall\" below for more details.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3982\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Low Altitude</span></h3> <p>If your Altitude die shows a 1, then you are in Low Altitude, and just like High Altitude, it's dangerous. If your Altitude die ever decrements below 1, or you're in Freefall and you end your turn in Low Altitude, you hit the ground. And probably explode.</p><p>If you end your turn in Low Altitude and you're not Freefalling, make a Flight saving throw to avoid colliding with the ground, ocean, rooftops, lava, etc. The DC for this saving throw depends on the terrain, and so is determined by the GM. The sample encounter at the end of this article contains an example.</p><p>Whenever you hit the ground, either by failing the Low Altitude saving throw, or by decrementing below 1 on the Altitude die, you immediately take falling damage, as described under \"Freefall.\"</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3983\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Action Phase</span></h2> <p>After your stunt phase ends, play moves into the action phase. During the action phase, you and any passengers with you on your mount or vehicle can take one action (except the Dash action) and one additional action for each Angle you created during the stunt phase. Passengers can also move about their vehicles, such as the deck of an airship, but pilots, mounts, and vehicles have used their movement during the stunt phase.</p><p>If you're a pilot, you can use an action to allow your mount or vehicle to take an action. This differs from how mounted combat works on the ground, chiefly because while airborne, you're not using a movement speed or measuring distance in feet, both of which the core mounted combat rules heavily rely on.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3984\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ranged Attacks and Melee Attacks</span></h3> <p>Ranged attacks and spells dominate in aerial combat. When you create an Angle, you can assume that you are putting yourself at an optimal distance to make any ranged attack you like.</p><p>Melee weapons can be used so long as your Altitude dice matches your targets. If your weapon has the reach property, you can also make melee attacks against a target one point of Altitude away. Note that the normal Altitude rules for advantage and disadvantage still apply to reach weapons!</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3985\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Taking Damage</span></h3> <p>Whenever you, your mount, or your vehicle is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw and takes damage as a result, decrement your Altitude by 1. Losing Altitude to damage can only occur once per turn.22 Note that this says once per turn, not once per round. For instance, each party member gets a chance to take the wyvern down a peg, but only once!</p><p>Damage is typically applied to a mount or vehicle first, because it's a much bigger target to hit in the midst of the chaos. A GM is free to rule that pilots and passengers can be directly targeted by attacks, potentially with disadvantage.</p><p>If your vehicle or mount is reduced to 0 hit points and you don't have a flying speed, you and any passengers without a flying speed begin Freefalling (see below).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3986\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Going Down</span></h3> <p>While reduced to less than half your hit points, you're Going Down, and your Altitude decreases by 1 at the end of each of your turns, no matter what.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3987\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Direct Hit</span></h3> <p>When you score a critical hit on an attack, it's a direct hit! The target rolls a d4, and drops that many points of Altitude immediately.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3988\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Knife-Fighting in a Phone Booth</span></h3> <p><i>The barbs of a grapnel bite into your hull! Two dragons lock onto each other with glittering jaws and teeth!</i></p><p>Sometimes things get really up close and personal. When you want to grapple a target, it works as usual; in place of a melee attack. A GM might rule that grappling is necessary for a boarding action, if vehicles are involved!</p><p>It's up to the GM to decide whether or not grappling an opponent makes you both start Freefalling. A griffon grappling a pegasus might be grounds for such a ruling, but an airship firing a grappling hook probably wouldn't!</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3989\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bugging Out</span></h3> <p>Sometimes you bite off more than you can chew—we've all been there—but how do you escape a foe that's got you out maneuvered in the air? Turning tail and running isn't so easy when they've zeroed in on you.</p><p>As an action, you can decide to Bug Out. To do this, announce your intentions, and pray. You now have a giant target on your back, and every bandit in the sky is free to take a potshot at it!</p><p>When you Bug Out, an enemy may use their reaction to make a Flight check against your passive Flight score, which is 10 + your Flight modifier. On a success, they can make a single spell or weapon attack against you.</p><p>If you survive the onslaught, you escape, find somewhere to land, and live to fly another day.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"3990\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Areas of Effect</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p></p><p>If a fireball spell, dragon's breath weapon, or other area of effect is used during an Aces High encounter, you can use your best judgement regarding which targets it can affect, or the rules for adjudicating areas of effect in the core rulebook, meant to guide GMs using theater-of-the-mind.</p><p></p><p>As a basic guideline, creatures with an altitude difference of 3 or more cannot be included in the same area of effect.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3991\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Freefall</span></h2> <p>The core rules say that creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall, up to a maximum of 20d6 bludgeoning damage.</p><p>In Aces High, normal rules for falling damage don't apply. You always take 20d6 bludgeoning damage when you hit the ground, because you're usually falling from extreme heights. A combatant flies so fast that touching the ground at all, outside of a controlled landing, is likely to spell disaster. Of course, a GM is free to rule that falling from Low Altitude deals less damage—something like 10d6, or 5d6—but these rulings should be made on instinct to keep the action moving!</p><p>This damage is applied to your mount or vehicle first if you have one (because they hit the ground first!), and leftover damage is then applied to you and your passengers. The pilot and passengers take the same amount of damage; it is not divided between them.</p><p>If this seems harsh, consider the following; falling out of the sky is literally the worst case scenario when committing to aerial combat. Also note that this level of lethality becomes much less pronounced for player characters somewhere between levels 8 and 10, or once they have over 70 hit points total, as they're less likely to suffer instant death.</p><p>Even characters who are basically gods have succumbed to the unyielding wrath of gravity, but that said, those who want a bit of danger at lower levels should embrace it!</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3992\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">How Fast Do Things Fall?</span></h3> <p>Good question! Objects (and creatures!) in the real world hit terminal velocity after about twelve seconds of falling. For our purposes, that's 2 rounds.</p><p>When in Freefall, decrement your Altitude die once on round one, twice on round two, and then three times every round after that.</p><p>This gives allies a window to Dive and save you! In order to do this, an ally must have a lower Altitude than you, and then must use an action to make a Flight check and snatch you from the jaws of death. The DC for this check is up to the GM, and could depend on how fast you are falling, how close to the ground you are, and even whether or not you need to be plucked from the deck of a failing airship!</p><p>A GM could also use the speed at which a creature or vehicle is falling to help determine how much Freefall damage they take if no one is able to rescue them. For example, round one is 5d6, round two is 10d6, and round three and beyond is 20d6!</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3993\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gut Moves</span></h2> <p>Gut Moves are like reactions—you can make them whenever you want in response to a trigger, so long as you have some Stunt dice lying around unspent.
