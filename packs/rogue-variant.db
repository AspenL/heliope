Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p><p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength.

A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats/u2014and wererats/u2014haunt the sewers.</p><p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law.
