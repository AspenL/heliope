The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of your languages. An eidolon shares the summoner's proficiency bonus. If your eidolon is killed, it cannot be summoned again until you have completed a long rest. An eidolon that is sent back to its plane otherwise may be summoned again with a ritual. Conjuring a creature with a spell does not return your Eidolon to its plane. Summoning your Eidolon does not cause other conjured creatures to be returned to their plane.</p><p>An eidolon acts on its own initiative, and it obeys any verbal/telepathic commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). Your eidolon can communicate with you telepathically, as long as you are on the same plane.</p><p>An Eidolon is incapicitated after being reduced to 0 hit points. It is killed after reaching a negative amount of hitpoints equal to its Constitution score. An eidolon is sent back to its plane if it is killed, or bainshed with a banishment or similar effect. An eidolon that is summoned after a long rest returns with all its hit points. A banished eidolon that was not killed is not healed, until you take a long rest. During a short rest, you may use your Hit Die to heal your eidolon just as you would heal yourself, using your Charisma modifier with the amount rolled. An eidolon remains until is killed, banished, or dismissed by you as an action. Dispel Magic does not banish your eidolon.</p><p>The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. It's general appearance is based on the chosen eidolon form, which may not be changed. As it gains new evolutions, an eidolon's apearance may change appropriately. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing tattoo that is identical to a tattoo that appears on the summoner as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this tatto can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1864\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Base Eidolon</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>An Eidolon's starting ability scores are 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of your languages. An eidolon shares the summoner's proficiency bonus. If your eidolon is killed, it cannot be summoned again until you have completed a long rest. An eidolon that is sent back to its plane otherwise may be summoned again with a ritual. Conjuring a creature with a spell does not return your Eidolon to its plane. Summoning your Eidolon does not cause other conjured creatures to be returned to their plane.</p><p>An eidolon acts on its own initiative, and it obeys any verbal/telepathic commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). Your eidolon can communicate with you telepathically, as long as you are on the same plane.</p><p>An Eidolon is incapicitated after being reduced to 0 hit points. It is killed after reaching a negative amount of hitpoints equal to its Constitution score. An eidolon is sent back to its plane if it is killed, or bainshed with a banishment or similar effect. An eidolon that is summoned after a long rest returns with all its hit points. A banished eidolon that was not killed is not healed, until you take a long rest. During a short rest, you may use your Hit Die to heal your eidolon just as you would heal yourself, using your Charisma modifier with the amount rolled. An eidolon remains until is killed, banished, or dismissed by you as an action. Dispel Magic does not banish your eidolon.</p><p>The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. It's general appearance is based on the chosen eidolon form, which may not be changed. As it gains new evolutions, an eidolon's apearance may change appropriately. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing tattoo that is identical to a tattoo that appears on the summoner as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this tatto can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1864\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Base Eidolon</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>An Eidolon's starting ability scores are 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

{"name":"Summon Eidolon","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>You gain the ability to summon to your side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of your languages. An eidolon shares the summoner's proficiency bonus. If your eidolon is killed, it cannot be summoned again until you have completed a long rest. An eidolon that is sent back to its plane otherwise may be summoned again with a ritual. Conjuring a creature with a spell does not return your Eidolon to its plane. Summoning your Eidolon does not cause other conjured creatures to be returned to their plane.</p><p>An eidolon acts on its own initiative, and it obeys any verbal/telepathic commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). Your eidolon can communicate with you telepathically, as long as you are on the same plane.</p><p>An Eidolon is incapicitated after being reduced to 0 hit points. It is killed after reaching a negative amount of hitpoints equal to its Constitution score. An eidolon is sent back to its plane if it is killed, or bainshed with a banishment or similar effect. An eidolon that is summoned after a long rest returns with all its hit points. A banished eidolon that was not killed is not healed, until you take a long rest. During a short rest, you may use your Hit Die to heal your eidolon just as you would heal yourself, using your Charisma modifier with the amount rolled. An eidolon remains until is killed, banished, or dismissed by you as an action. Dispel Magic does not banish your eidolon.</p><p>The eidolon's physical appearance is up to the summoner, but it always appears as some sort of fantastical creature. It's general appearance is based on the chosen eidolon form, which may not be changed. As it gains new evolutions, an eidolon's apearance may change appropriately. This control is not fine enough to make the eidolon appear like a specific creature. The eidolon also bears a glowing tattoo that is identical to a tattoo that appears on the summoner as long as the eidolon is summoned. While this tatto can be hidden through mundane means, it cannot be concealed through magic that changes appearance, such as alter self or polymorph (although invisibility does conceal it as long as the spell lasts).</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"3390\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Base Eidolon</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>An Eidolon's starting ability scores are 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
