Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing to adulthood while their peers continue to live as children, growing restless in the timeless elven realms. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"312\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Of Two Worlds</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they're on par with both parents, though they're neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie, somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"313\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Diplomats or Wanderers</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.</p><p>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"314\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Half-Elf Names</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions.

They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p><p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"167\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hidden Woodland and Realms</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees.

They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace.

Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies.

While the first warforged were mindless automatons, House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"502\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Living Steel and Stone.</span></span> <p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids.

For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.</p><p>The typical warforged has a sexless body shape. Some warforged ignore the concept of gender entirely, while others adopt a gender identity.</p><p>The more a warforged develops its individuality, the more likely it is to modify its body, seeking out an artificer to customize the look of its face, limbs, and plating.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"504\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quirks.</span></span> <p>Warforged often display an odd personality trait or two, given how new they are to the world.

This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.</p><p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.</p><p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"147\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Clans and Kingdoms</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></h3><p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p><p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p><p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"148\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></h3><p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"149\">Slow to Trust</span></h4><p><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></p><p>Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. \"The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,\" is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elves.</span></p><p>\"It's not wise to depend on the elves.

Different humans train in a wide variety of fighting styles, including those particularly favored by other races. A human mage might use any of the five colors of mana, while mages of other races focus on one of only two colors. Human @background[vizier|psa|viziers] serve all five gods, and different human @background[initiate|psa|initiates] excel in different trials. Humans defy trends and categorization, and opponents who face a human in one-on-one combat can't know what kind of fight to expect—from the foresight and cunning often associated with Kefnet, to a ruthlessness that emulates Bontu. At the beginning of such a fight, this uncertainty can give an edge to the human combatant.</p><p>Once the fight has begun, of course, victory relies on different factors. But here, the human drive toward perfection once more tilts the scales in their favor. Humans are willing to go to any length, exhausting all available options, to reach the pinnacle of achievement and win the favor of the God-Pharaoh.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"352\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Two Roads to Perfection </span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>As diverse as they are in most respects, the humans of Amonkhet share a drive toward perfection. However, they approach this challenge differently.

For them, the best way to earn a place in the afterlife is to hone a single facet of their character to the utmost quality, and as @background[initiate|psa|initiates], they hope to put that quality to use in all five trials. A mage @background[initiate|psa] who identifies with Hazoret might cultivate zeal above all other virtues, master spells of fiery magic to channel that powerful emotion, and rely on raw energy and enthusiasm to get through the four trials leading up to Hazoret's final test. An @background[initiate|psa] dedicated to Oketra, on the other hand, relies on cooperation, solidarity, and teamwork to get through the trials—even Bontu's Trial of Ambition, which attempts to break down such bonds. To Oketra's disciple, ambition means a drive to help an entire crop of initiates achieve glory together, rather than exalting oneself over others. Humans with this viewpoint see their chosen virtue coloring all others, and believe that the five gods offer their people a choice of which virtue to emulate and emphasize.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"354\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Perfection through Balance.</span></span> <p>Other humans believe that true perfection lies in mastering all the virtues, without giving preference to any one over the others. They compare themselves to multifaceted stones whose beauty lies in the polished perfection of every facet. These humans are careful not to let their skills in one area outshine their other efforts, and if they grow too accomplished in one set of skills, they set it aside to concentrate their training on others until their abilities are in balance once more.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Philosophically, such humans believe that the gods are five in number so as to remind the people of Amonkhet not to focus their attention on a single god or a single virtue, but to serve the gods equally and master their teachings to the same degree. Thus they hope to achieve a balanced state of perfection that will guarantee their admission into the afterlife.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"355\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Combat Classes</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Most human initiates focus their studies on a single specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or magical combat. Humans who choose hand-to-hand combat might focus with single-minded devotion on the use of the sickle-bladed khopesh (treat as a @item[longsword|phb]). Other hand-to-hand specialists take a broader perspective and study the use of all weapons equally.</p><p>Some humans, however, apply the idea of perfection through balance to these combat specializations as well, fusing multiple styles together into a unique blend. For example, a human initiate might use spells to shape sand into a sword or to wreathe arrows with life-draining magic. Other initiates strike with an axe in one hand while throwing smaller axes with the other, employing techniques of both hand-to-hand and long-range combat. Some humans use slings to launch fireballs, create illusory nets to restrain their opponents, or craft their blades from solid toxins.</p></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PSA","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"PSA","hash":"human%20(amonkhet)_psa","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"becca731d9d10ee9231a2c283186dfe9c4fe0b2a"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/family-tree.svg","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"GylycKQC6L4sbIgn"}],"img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/races/PSA/Human%20(Amonkhet).webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955847800,"modifiedTime":1669955847800,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"EtLU2wrfx3Kl6H1C"}

Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"125\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Proud Dragon Kin</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are smiting, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p><p>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor-bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic like gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"126\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Self-Sufficient Clans</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p><p>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency, of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of that particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p><p>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a client needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races or even from the gods.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"127\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Dragonborn Names</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor.

They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors black, red, white, silver, or gold with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red.

Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous.

Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"470\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gnome.</span></span> <p>Gnomes don't look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor.

Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"473\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Tiefling.</span></span> <p>Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"PHB","hash":"tiefling_phb","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"3d60c9e37cab8a6de635635f11b17d80096f2844"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"icons/magic/air/wind-tornado-cyclone-red-orange.webp","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"Zho2giq3vXkXabdV"}],"img":"icons/magic/air/wind-tornado-cyclone-red-orange.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955848983,"modifiedTime":1669955848983,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"NUPEdgY1ed3NyVHh"}

Usually, faceless tend to have a slender build with height a little shorter than that of an average human. Their eyes are colorless, and their pale smooth skin is usually colored in some shade of gray, rarely showing a hint of blue, red, or another color. Their hair tends to be white or silver, often with a hue of another color like pink or gold. It's common for the faceless to also keep some characteristics of their ancestors from Material Plane, such as pointed ears of elven parents, stout figure of a dwarf, or tusks of an orc.</p><p>Of course, none of this applies once the faceless turn into someone else.

A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler.</p><p>In creating a changeling adventurer, consider the character's relationships with people around them.

It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth. They build an identity over time, crafting a persona with a history and beliefs. This focused identity helps a changeling pinpoint a particular skill or emotion. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; there might be three healers in a community, but whoever is on duty will adopt the persona of Tek, the kindly old medic. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"9337\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Changeling Names.</span></span> <p>A changeling might use a different name for each mask and persona and adopt new names as easily as they change faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be simple and monosyllabic; however, there are often accents to a changeling's name that are expressed through shapeshifting, something single-skins will likely miss.

Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so.

Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Child Names:</span> Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Male Adult Names:</span> Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Female Adult Names:</span> Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Family Names (Common Translations):</span> Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Nailo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)</p></li></ul></div></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MTF","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"MTF","hash":"elf%20(sea)_mtf","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"56b285e209af441bbc8cffcd691aee40e44347f2"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"icons/magic/nature/leaf-glow-maple-teal.webp","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"4aMyiuhhJliwTyzo"}],"img":"icons/magic/nature/leaf-glow-maple-teal.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955846602,"modifiedTime":1669955846602,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"SggXFk9UlewtlgO8"}

Their methods reflect common sense and remarkable resourcefulness. During a bountiful summer, they store away excess nuts, fruit, and berries.

Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next. The firbolgs' magical heritage also expresses itself in other ways; those who become bards preserve the clan's lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes friendly with elves.</p><p>Firbolg rogues are typically scouts tasked with spying on neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are most common among firbolgs whose homes border human settlements.</p><p>Firbolg barbarians are rare except among clans that face constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders.</p><p>Firbolg clerics and paladins are usually dedicated to nature gods and are seen as enforcers of that god's will.</p><p>Firbolg warlocks are rare, but some clans forge alliances and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings.</p><p>Firbolg monks are almost entirely unheard of, though a monastery might take in the young survivors of a devastated firbolg clan.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"228\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hidden Shepherds.</span></span> <p>As caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind.

This approach allows them to avoid the politics and struggles of elves, humans, and orcs. Such events concern the firbolgs only when the events affect the forest.</p><p>Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost. The firbolgs' presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better.</p><p>If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"229\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Outcast Adventurers.</span></span> <p>As guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature.

They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world.</p><p>A few rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes.

For example, in real life, the ability to read—be it a book, a sign, even a clock—is not processed in the subconscious part of the human brain, therefore we are unable to read in our dreams. While a dozing creature might believe it's reading, a sand speaker inside the dream may come across inscriptions written in gibberish or books filled with blank pages. Similarly, creatures in dreams are products of the dreamer's subconscious and may look or sound differently than who the dreamer understands them to be—if they have a face at all! Knowing this information can help GMs and players convey dreams as distinct, vivid experiences with unique problems for characters to solve.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"522\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages.</span></span> <p>You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t<hr class=\"hr-1\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p class=\"rd__quote-line \">“<i>Azita clasped her hands together and leaned forward on her oaken desk inquisitively.

Led by Oneirus the Eternal, the angels sought to drive back the unfathomable evils and prevent the aberrations from disrupting their divine works. During a cataclysmic battle, Oneirus' radiant fire scorched the iridescent sand, giving it form and infusing it with life. Humanoid figures of molten glass, the original sand speakers, rose from the astral desert and knelt before the archangel.</p><p>Oneirus invited each sand speaker to pledge themselves to a righteous cause and return with the angels to the celestial host. Many accepted and became prophetic messengers, while others decided to explore their newfound freedom, wandering the sands like interplanar nomads. Some, however, were tempted by unintelligible whispers emanating from the Abyss, rejecting Oneirus in favor of maleficent beings lurking beyond the sands.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"524\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Extraplanar Emissaries</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Despite their smooth complexion, sand speakers are composed of millions of tiny granules suffused with cosmic energy. Sand speakers travel the multiverse in service to meddling archfey, imprisoned fiends, and forgotten deities hoping to reassert their godhood. Some conduct divine outreach as heralds, while others tempt sleeping souls on behalf of ambitious devils. A sand speaker might appear before a belligerent zealot, chastising their actions in hopes of averting a holy crusade without a single casualty.</p><p>Some sand speakers, called thought thieves, engage in subconscious subterfuge, slipping into the minds of influential figures to steal precious secrets or plant the seed of an idea in hopes of prompting action in the material world. Expert thought thieves are graceful shadows, sneaking past the defenses of well-guarded noble estates, fortified prisons, and the magically warded towers of paranoid mages.</p><p>The ability to dream walk is both a blessing and a curse.

While some prefer hidden lairs on the outskirts of civilizations or adopt a regular disguise, most sand speakers are vagabonds, constantly on the move to minimize the odds of being recognized by a former target. Sand speaker societies are rare, and take the form of caravans or mobile camps.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"526\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Boundless Perspective</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>By the time a sand speaker reaches maturity, they have seen dozens of dreams. However, a sand speaker's ability comes at a price: the first time that they dream walk, they can no longer have dreams of their own. Instead, they must live vicariously through the fantasies of others, beholding the wonder of the unrestrained mind but tasting none of its fruits for themselves.</p><p>Dream walks inspire sand speakers to explore the real world. To a sand speaker, each dream is an illusion—alluring, foreign, and hollow. They observe delicious foods, wondrous curiosities, and breathtaking landscapes imagined by dreamers. Sand speakers chase these visions during their waking hours, venturing out into the world in search of iconic landmarks, gourmet recipes, and famous individuals that inspired dreams they've visited.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"527\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sand Speaker Personalities</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Though sand speakers lose the ability to have new dreams after their first dream walk, they can still relive old ones. In sand speaker culture, these old dreams are symbols of fate called omens. Typically, the same omen recurs for weeks, months, or years. A sand speaker has no control over which omen they experience each night and always recalls it perfectly upon waking. Like tarot card readings or casting runes, a sand speaker draws meaning from their omen, believing it holds some hidden clue to their destiny.</p><p>The Sand Speaker Omens table displays possible omens for your character, while the Sand Speaker Quirks table contains specific quirks to help you portray them.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"528\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sand Speaker Omens.</span></span> <table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d8]]</th><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">My omen involves a...</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Vault filled with treasures from a distant land.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Simple memory shared with a loved one who's no longer around.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Recurring symbol which I do not recognize.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Battle against formidable foe.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Mysterious creature.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Famous person I have never actually met.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Test of great importance.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\">8</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Horrible nightmare.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"529\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Sand Speaker Quirks.</span></span> <table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d8]]</th><th class=\"text-align-left\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Quirk</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Your body is shaped like a round-bottom flask.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Sand shifts beneath your glassy skin, changing color to reflect your mood.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">You have a phobia of water.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">When someone wrongs you or your companions, you discretely fill their belongings with sand.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">You are a thrill seeker, chasing the passion you've witnessed in others' dreams.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">You look for meaning in every action or symbol.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">Others often mistake you for someone they know.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"text-align-left\" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\">8</td><td class=\"text-align-left\">You talk in your sleep.

For other changelings, a new face may reveal an aspect of their soul.</p><p>The first changelings in the multiverse appeared in the Feywild, and the wondrous, mutable essence of that plane lingers in changelings today—even in those changelings who have never set foot in the fey realm. Each changeling decides how to use their shape-shifting ability, channeling either the peril or the joy of the Feywild. Sometimes they adopt new forms for the sake of mischief or malice, and other times they don a new identity to right wrongs or delight the downtrodden.</p><p>In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth, crafting whole personas complete with histories and beliefs. A changeling adventurer might have personas for many situations, including negotiation, investigation, and combat.</p><p>Personas can be shared by multiple changelings; a community might be home to three healer changelings, with whoever is on duty adopting the persona of Andrea, the gentle physician. Personas can even be passed down through a family, allowing a younger changeling to take advantage of contacts established by the persona's previous users.</p>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"MPMM","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"MPMM","hash":"changeling_mpmm","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"e2b67becc3028f0e3900f13e38da8a591f85f275"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/family-tree.svg","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"d7Kgu2HzkDJ9MX6X"}],"img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/races/MPMM/Changeling.png","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955846100,"modifiedTime":1669955846100,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"ZoDpQKxrKBJQjyNN"}

Despite their sharp teeth, they consider biting to be an uncouth and unworthy combat tactic.</p><p>Nearly every khenra is born a fraternal or identical twin, and a pair of khenra twins forms an extremely close emotional bond unknown to most other residents of Amonkhet. The death of one twin in training or the trials causes a tremendous shock to the survivor, who typically grows more aggressive and foolhardy in battle. The rare khenra who are born without twins are believed to have killed their siblings in the womb, and are thus viewed as natural-born initiates, sure to achieve a glorified death in the Trial of Zeal.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"378\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Strength and Zeal</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Many khenra believe that they are created in the image of Hazoret, and though they venerate all five gods in the manner of all citizens of Naktamun, they have a special affinity for the teachings and philosophy of the god of zeal. These khenra share a deep love of combat, especially hand-to-hand fighting, and they devote themselves to their training with particular intensity.</p><p>The familial bond experienced in the Family Temple of Hazoret's monument is a part of every khenra's experience as one of a pair of twins. As such, these khenra sometimes think of themselves as Hazoret's children even before they finish the fourth trial. For her part, Hazoret seems to favor khenra among her @background[vizier|psa|viziers], and some say that she shows particular favor to khenra @background[initiate|psa|initiates] who survive to reach the Trial of Zeal.</p><p>Other khenra choose to distance themselves from Hazoret and the reckless battle frenzy she encourages. They devote themselves instead to honing their physical strength, resilience, and adaptability, inspired and guided by the teachings of Rhonas. These khenra have a great fondness for wrestling (or tussling, as they often call it), and they keep careful track of the matches they win and lose against other @background[initiate|psa|initiates]. They often seek out matches against @race[minotaur (amonkhet)|psa|minotaurs], enjoying the challenge of pitting their sinewy strength against the brute muscle of larger and heavier opponents.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"379\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Combat Classes</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Khenra, especially those devoted to Hazoret, are particularly drawn to hand-to-hand combat styles. But the other styles each have their own appeal, and khenra initiates might find themselves specializing in any of the three.</p><p>Khenra who focus on hand-to-hand combat often wield the khopesh—a large sickle-bladed sword—as their weapon of choice (treat as a @item[longsword|phb]). Khenra wield these blades with devastating accuracy and power, landing one crushing blow after another in a hail of furious attacks. They favor lightweight armor that doesn't impede their movement, often comparing fighting in organized ranks to wearing a leash that limits their ability to charge, lunge, and roll away from danger. Their natural aggression makes them ideal shock troops, scouts, and skirmishers. And that aggression is even more pronounced in khenra who have already lost their twin, and who sometimes lose any sense of self-preservation as a result.</p><p>Khenra who focus on long-range combat prefer hurled weapons—spears and javelins—over bows and slings, and they are known and feared for their deadly accuracy. They carry small cases of @item[javelin|phb|javelins] into combat, and feel ashamed if they reach the end of a battle with any weapons left unthrown. A khenra might ride on a @item[chariot|phb] as a @item[spear|phb] thrower, sometimes augmenting attacks with minor spells of fire magic.</p><p>Many khenra mages specialize in fire spells, creating blades or hails of flame to sear and scorch their foes. Their strategy emphasizes overwhelming initial assaults, in magical emulation of Hazoret's battle frenzy. Others prefer magic that augments their natural speed and strength, bolsters their endurance, or drains strength from their enemies. They work to hone their spells alongside their bodies, incorporating elements of hand-to-hand combat into their spellcasting.</p></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PSA","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"PSA","hash":"khenra_psa","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"ef1b5fe9d84fca81c506e66c75745791f815b373"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/family-tree.svg","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"35","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"jXtZ8Er1blmdeDdL"}],"img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/races/PSA/Khenra.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955848009,"modifiedTime":1669955848009,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"hduQZrK6b9Aa7u1n"}

This section is aimed at DMs who wish to expand the race selections for their campaigns beyond the typical folk of D&amp;D.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"288\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Why a Monstrous Character?</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Creating characters as creatures normally cast as villains offers up some interesting roleplaying possibilities. Whether played for comedy, as a tragic story of betrayal and loss, or as an antihero, a monstrous character gives a player a chance to take on an unusual challenge in the campaign. Before allowing monstrous characters in your campaign, consider the following three questions.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"289\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rare or Mundane?</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Consider how common orc, goblin, and similar adventurers are in your setting. Are they regarded as no stranger than elves or dwarves? Are they met with suspicion? The role these races play in your setting should determine the kinds of reactions that such characters meet.</p><p>Don't be afraid to push things to an extreme. An orc character might have to venture into town in disguise or remain in the wilderness, for fear of imprisonment or mob violence. Be sure to talk to the group about how such characters can expect the world to treat them. Some players like the challenge of taking on an outcast, but don't set up one expectation and deliver another.</p><p>You can establish a monstrous creature as just another culture in your campaign, one that has alliances and rivalries with humans, elves, and dwarves. A hobgoblin kingdom might serve as a buffer between a human kingdom and a blighted region overrun by the spawn of Kyuss. Kobolds might be city builders, the architects of grand, heavily fortified edifices, which other folk dwell in for a price. The cultural notes in chapter 1 are the standard D&amp;D depiction of these creatures, but by no means do they define them for your campaign. Use them as a starting point for your own ideas.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"290\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Outcast or Ambassador?</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Consider how a monstrous character's native culture views the character. Is the character an outcast, a spy, an ambassador, or something else? Work with the player to determine how the character ended up as an adventurer.</p><p>The character's bond is a great starting point to consider for this question. How did the bond drive the character to adventure? The character's trait, flaw, and ideal can also play a role in fleshing out the story.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"291\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Friends or Enemies?</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Figure out what special ties the character has to other members of the adventuring party. An orc warlock might be the dwarf ranger's sworn enemy, but the two are forced to work together to defeat a mutual foe. Perhaps the kobold sorcerer was the tiefling wizard's familiar, transformed by an irate archmage in return for some petty insult. The hobgoblin paladin might have been human once, but crossed the wrong hag and was cursed to take on an evil guise. A creative tie between a monstrous character and the rest of the party helps make for a memorable campaign.</p><p>The Monstrous Origin table gives a number of ideas for adding a monstrous character to the campaign.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d8]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Origin</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\">You are a spy sent to undermine your enemies from within.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"col-10\">You are the victim of a curse or polymorph spell.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"col-10\">You were raised by humans, elves, or dwarves and have adopted their culture.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"col-10\">At a young age, you adopted a human religion and now serve it faithfully.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"5\" data-roll-max=\"5\">5</td><td class=\"col-10\">You received divine insight that sent you on your path, and occasionally receive new visions that guide you.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"6\" data-roll-max=\"6\">6</td><td class=\"col-10\">Your sworn enemy is an ally of your people, forcing you to leave your tribe to gain vengeance.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"7\" data-roll-max=\"7\">7</td><td class=\"col-10\">An evil entity corrupted your people's society.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"8\" data-roll-max=\"8\">8</td><td class=\"col-10\">An injury or strange event caused you to lose all memory of your past, but occasional flashes of it return to you.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"VGM","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"VGM","hash":"goblin_vgm","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"9d4e03e422cea139e362bd8d820c39f0c979afee"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/family-tree.svg","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"9OSevXpNUSYyWDva"}],"img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/races/VGM/Goblin.png","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955847408,"modifiedTime":1669955847408,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"iaNbfyRX8rbrG31c"}

This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most leonin an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome.</p><p>Leonin often act with confidence, which can come off as imperiousness.

In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p><p>The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p></div></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"184\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Slender and Graceful</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p><p>Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"185\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">A Timeless Perspective</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p><p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"186\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hidden Woodland and Realms</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).</p><p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"187\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Haughty but Gracious</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-special-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></span><p>Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious - even to those who fall short of their high expectations - which is most non-elves.

Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"192\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Elf Names</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.</p><p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf's adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Child Names:</span> Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Male Adult Names:</span> Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Female Adult Names:</span> Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Family Names (Common Translations):</span> Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Nailo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)</p></li></ul></div></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"PHB","hash":"elf%20(high)_phb","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"4cfcb9adc48a412b924c8dd682c449d7176216d4"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"icons/magic/nature/leaf-glow-maple-green.webp","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"30","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"2JSa8BZG2r3jr1Rf"}],"img":"icons/magic/nature/leaf-glow-maple-green.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955846511,"modifiedTime":1669955846511,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"k6ILIdgsWsHXLuGM"}

Their physical resemblance to the god of knowledge is reflected in the metal discipline, focus, and confidence for which aven spellcasters are known. They wield magic of air, wind, and sometimes water to buffet their foes, enhance their own flight, and counter enemy attacks. Hawk-headed aven who follow the path of the mage are more likely to learn sand-based magic that can cloud the air, blast their foes, or bury enemies in living dunes.</p><p>Hawk-headed aven are often drawn to master tech-niques of long-range combat, whether the javelin that is the preferred weapon of many, the bow, or other thrown weapons. Whatever weapon they use, aven hover and swoop in the air above the fray, seeking the opportune moment to strike in exactly the right place. In line with the teachings of the god of solidarity, they often fly in tight formations with other aven in their crops, supporting and protecting each other. Aven take great pride in the precision of their attacks, relying on their keen vision and superior vantage points. They view the sharp tip of a @item[javelin|phb] or @item[arrow|phb] as a symbol of their love for precision, and some initiates maintain carefully tended collections of spearheads or arrowheads.</p><p>A relatively small number of aven of both varieties end up focusing on hand-to-hand combat. Even there, they use their ability to fly to great advantage, often swooping down on their foes from a great height. The speed and power of a blow from a diving aven can be utterly devastating, but such a strike poses a tremendous risk to the aven as well as the target. An aven who fails to pull up from the dive in time can suffer even worse injuries than the target of the attack. Aven often minimize this risk by hurling @item[javelin|phb|javelins] while they dive, then pulling up early after a successful throw.</p></div></div>\n\t\t\t</div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PSA","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":null,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"races.html","source":"PSA","hash":"aven%20(hawk-headed)_psa","propDroppable":"race"},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"Item.","hash":"1878fa83c7b1d6546297f034e86de96c8850a53d"}},"effects":[{"label":"Walk Speed","icon":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/family-tree.svg","changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.movement.walk","mode":5,"value":"25","priority":4}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null,"combat":null},"origin":null,"tint":null,"transfer":true,"flags":{},"_id":"IVdlxdyZRWioAQ6c"}],"img":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/races/PSA/Aven.webp","_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1669955845921,"modifiedTime":1669955845921,"lastModifiedBy":"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"pjd4PUp7eb3ERd0h":3},"_id":"s3p9nHhABCqaH3B8"}

It's common for the faceless to also keep some characteristics of their ancestors from Material Plane, such as pointed ears of elven parents, stout figure of a dwarf, or tusks of an orc.</p><p>Of course, none of this applies once the faceless turn into someone else. With their uncanny talent, they can take form of anyone they have seen or anyone they could could imagine.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"308\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Quick to Change, Slow to Decide</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></h2><p>Many would consider an ability to change their looks at any time a gift, but to the faceless it can seem at times like a curse. Due to fears of prejudice, many faceless spend little to no time in their true form. Some try to have an ordinary life, changing their form rarely. Others take full advantage of their powers, becoming infiltrators, thieves, blackmailers and spies. Yet, some faceless live in their true form, to show others that their kind could be trusted.</p><p>Due to their chaotic nature, they change their moods as often as they change their appearance. It's not unusual for faceless to be indecisive and work on more than one task at a time. Their innate ability of changing gives them an uncanny ability to deceive others. Befriending a faceless could either be a blessing, or a disaster.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"309\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Constant Search</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></h2><p>Touched by Far Realms, faceless feel a need to search something their whole life. This longing drives them, whether they seek their true self, forbidden knowledge, or their ancestor. When a faceless takes up adventuring, it might be to fulfill its need. Some get distracted on the way by the fame and fortune, but sooner or later their desire will resurface.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"310\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Faceless Names</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></h2><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>There are two kinds of faceless names, depending on the culture they're born into.
