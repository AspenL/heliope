hand of an ancient elf, her eyes as black as the raven's. Soft words are spoken, and the elf nods in agreement.</p><p>A young orc lets out a bellowing roar and flames burst into a form taller than an ogre causing her enemies to flee. She holds up her spear and the flames pour from the roaring fire spirit to it, swirling about it, causing it to roar alight with searing magical flames.</p><p>The mysterious halfling woman gives a knowing smile, her unseeing eyes focused on you. She knows what you've come for, and tosses a handful of incense into the fire; what it is she sees in there? Your fate? Your destiny? As she speaks, it is only in riddle.</p><p>Occultists are those that follow the old ways, a path of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it. They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that few fully understand, even those that use them, but they know it will work, for it always has.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"956\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Ancient Traditions</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>Occultists are spell casters following legacies that go far back.

Occultists tread between the arcane and the divine, not necessarily worshiping any god, but treating gods and spirits alike with cautious respect for their domains, asking for the what they take, and carefully giving thought to their actions.</p><p>Each tradition that appears in the Occultist is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story. Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their traditions, and they are often seen in this context. Though villagers and the superstitious might fear them and their magic, they may be more likely to turn to them than a Wizard, for at least an Occultist makes sense to them, even if they are scared by their powers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"957\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spiritual Magic</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>A common thread of the magic wilded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the demi-divine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic oft through the intermediaries of the power of gods, spirits, elementals, and more. An Occultist is fundamentally tied into the greater magical world, being neither a source of magic nor an academic researcher of it, but wielding it through intuition, cunning, and tradition.</p><p>Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects; the verbal component of an Occultist spell might be the spirit they call upon to work the effect they wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or words in a language that binds or persuades.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"958\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creating a Occultist</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h2> <p>When creating an Occultist, the most important decision will be what Tradition you follow.
