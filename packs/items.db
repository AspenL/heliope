Spells such as @spell[identify] and @spell[divination] can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</p><p>A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating.

Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the <i>Crook of Rao</i> was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the <i>Crook of Rao</i> -potentially for the final time.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"6370\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Random Properties.</span></span> <p>The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/book.html#DMG\">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>:</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">2 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial] properties</li><li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial] property</li><li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental] property</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"6371\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spells.</span></span> <p>The crook has 6 charges.

Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the <i>Crook of Rao</i>, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent @spell[gate] spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the <i>Crook of Rao</i>. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate.

The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.</p><p>A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates [[/r 1d100]] hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as @spell[identify] and @spell[divination] can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.</p><p>A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating.

For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a @item[devastation orb of air|PotA] and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes [[/r 1d6]] rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.</p><p>Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius.

Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.</p><p>After the fall of Shanatar, the <i>Wyrmskull Throne</i> fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the @creature[storm giant] Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the <i>Wyrmskull Throne</i>, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.</p><p>Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is @condition[paralyzed] and encased in a magical force field.
